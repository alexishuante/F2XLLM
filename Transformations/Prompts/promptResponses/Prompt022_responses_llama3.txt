Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C++ code using HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenACC (for NVIDIA GPUs) for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements an AXPY operation:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma hip launch_kernel
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that the above code uses HIP for AMD GPUs and OpenACC for NVIDIA GPUs. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to generate parallel kernels for the loop that follows, and the #pragma hip launch_kernel directive tells the compiler to generate a HIP kernel for AMD GPUs.
Also, note that the loop starts from 0, not 1, as in C++ arrays are 0-indexed, unlike Fortran which is 1-indexed.
You can call this function from your host code, passing the necessary arguments, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float a = 2.0f;
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    // Rest of the code...

    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile your code with the necessary flags to enable HIP and OpenACC. For example, with the NVIDIA HPC SDK, you can compile with:
nvc++ -o saxpy saxpy.cpp -acc -gpu=managed
And with the AMD ROCm compiler, you can compile with:
hipcc -o saxpy saxpy.cpp
Note: The above code assumes that the x and y arrays are already allocated and initialized on the host. If you want to allocate and initialize them on the device, you'll need to use HIP or OpenACC memory management functions, such as hipMalloc or acc_malloc, and modify the code accordingly.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GLOBAL_KERNEL, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, 
                  saxpy_kernel, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The saxpy_kernel function is executed on the GPU and performs the AXPY operation.
Also, the GLOBAL_KERNEL macro is used to define the kernel launch configuration, and the dim3 type is used to specify the block and grid dimensions.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 3:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GLOBAL_KERNEL, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, 
                   saxpy_kernel, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The saxpy_kernel function is executed in parallel on the GPU, with each thread handling a single element of the arrays x and y.
Also, note that the GLOBAL_KERNEL macro is used to specify the kernel launch configuration. This macro is defined in the HIP runtime API, and it expands to the appropriate kernel launch parameters.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and run it on a system with a HIP-enabled GPU.
You can also use OpenACC with C/C++ by using the PGI compiler which supports OpenACC. Here is how your code would look like with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
You can compile this code with the PGI compiler, which supports OpenACC. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to generate an OpenACC kernel for the following code, and the #pragma acc loop independent directive tells the compiler that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GLOBAL_KERNEL, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, 
                  n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void GLOBAL_KERNEL(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The GLOBAL_KERNEL function is the kernel that gets executed on the GPU, and it performs the SAXPY operation.
You can also use the HIP kernel language to write the kernel in a more concise way:
void saxpy(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  hipKernelLaunch((hipLaunchKernel)&saxpy_kernel, n, a, x, y);
}

__kernel void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
This code uses the HIP kernel language to define the saxpy_kernel kernel, which is then launched using the hipKernelLaunch function.
You can also use the HIP template to write the kernel in a more concise way:
template <typename T>
void saxpy(int n, T a, const T *x, T *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel((hipLaunchKernel)&saxpy_kernel<T>, n, a, x, y);
}

template <typename T>
__kernel void saxpy_kernel(int n, T a, const T *x, T *y) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
This code uses templates to define the saxpy_kernel kernel for any type T, and then launches the kernel using the hipLaunchKernel function.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenACC (for NVIDIA GPUs) for the AXPY operation:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc kernels
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
  #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed single precision floating point numbers (float) in the C/C++ code, as the original Fortran code uses "real" which typically corresponds to single precision. If you need double precision, you can replace "float" with "double".
Also, the HIP and OpenACC directives are similar, but not identical. The "#pragma acc loop independent" directive is used to indicate that each iteration of the loop can be executed independently, which is important for parallelization.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) or an OpenACC-enabled compiler (such as pgcc) to generate code that can run on AMD or NVIDIA GPUs, respectively.


Output 6:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GLOBAL_KERNEL, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, 
                   saxpy_kernel, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note: This code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The GLOBAL_KERNEL macro is used to define the kernel launch configuration. The saxpy_kernel function is the actual kernel that performs the AXPY operation.
Also, you can use the hipify tool to convert the OpenACC code to HIP code. Here's an example:
hipify -cpp -o saxpy.hip.cpp saxpy.f90
This will generate a HIP version of the code in the file saxpy.hip.cpp.


Output 7:
Here's the equivalent code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((void *)axpy_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void axpy_kernel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that HIP (HIP Infrastructure for Portable acceleration) is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for GPU computing, similar to OpenACC. The code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU.
Also, note that the code assumes that the input arrays x and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU device. You may need to add additional code to handle the data transfer between host and device, depending on your specific use case.


Output 8:
Here is a version of the Fortran OpenACC code that implements an AXPY operation using C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(saxpy_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original Fortran code, but uses CUDA-style indexing and threading.
Also, the HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function, which is saxpy_kernel in this case.
You can compile this code using a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 9:
Here's the equivalent code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(saxpy_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(256), 0, 0, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < n) {
    y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The saxpy_kernel function is executed in parallel on the GPU, with each thread handling a single element of the arrays x and y. The blockDim.x and gridDim.x variables control the number of threads and blocks, respectively.
Also, note that this is a C++ version of the code, if you want a C version, you can simply remove the const keyword and change the include to <hip.h> instead of <hip/hip_runtime.h>.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GLOBAL_KERNEL, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, 
                  kernel_saxpy, n, a, x, y);
}

__global__ void kernel_saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel_saxpy function is executed on the GPU and performs the SAXPY operation.
Also, I assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C++. If you need to use double precision, you can replace float with double in the code.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
