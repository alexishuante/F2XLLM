Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <hip/hip_complex.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}

// HIP kernel for SpMV
__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[idx]; j < row[idx+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[idx] = sum;
  }
}

// HIP version of SpMV with launch bounds
void spmv_parallel_hip(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
  spmv_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
  hipDeviceSynchronize();
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API for AMD GPUs, and the spmv_parallel_hip function launches the spmv_kernel kernel on the GPU. The spmv_parallel function is the same as the original OpenMP code, but with HIP-specific modifications.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on an AMD GPU.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is written in CUDA C++ and performs the same operations as the original Fortran OpenMP code. The HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function.
Also, note that the code assumes that the input arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You may need to add additional code to handle memory management and data transfer between host and device.


Output 3:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, and int for the row and col arrays. You can modify the types as needed for your specific use case. Also, I've used the hip compiler directives to parallelize the loop using HIP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler. You can then run the code on a GPU or CPU device, depending on your system configuration.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows you to run kernels on AMD GPUs. The spmv_kernel function is launched on the GPU using the hipLaunchKernelGGL function, and the kernel is executed in parallel across the blocks and threads.
Also, note that I've assumed that the val, row, col, x, and y arrays are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You may need to add additional code to handle the memory management and data transfer between the host and device.
You can use the following command to compile the code:
hipcc -o spmv spmv.cpp
And run it using:
./spmv
You can also use the hipconfig command to specify the GPU architecture and other compilation options. For example:
hipconfig -g gpu_arch=gfx900 -o spmv spmv.cpp
This will compile the code for the AMD Radeon RX 590 GPU architecture.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or other types as needed. Also, HIP is a C++ API, so I've used C++ syntax. If you need C code, let me know and I can provide that as well.
Also, make sure to compile with HIP compiler and run on a GPU to get the benefits of parallelization.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <hip/hip_complex.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note: This code assumes a HIP-enabled system with an AMD GPU. Also, the float data type is used, but you can modify it to double or other types as needed.
To compile and run this code, you'll need to use a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) and link against the HIP runtime library. You can also use OpenMP flags to enable parallelization on the GPU.
For example:
hipcc -o spmv spmv.cpp -lhhip
Then, you can run the code on the GPU using:
./spmv
This will execute the SpMV operation in parallel on the GPU using HIP and OpenMP.


Output 7:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, I've used the hip compiler directives to parallelize the loop using HIP. This code can be compiled with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler.
Here's a brief explanation of the changes:
The subroutine keyword is not needed in C/C++.
The intent keywords are not needed, as the variables are passed by reference.
The real and integer keywords are not needed, as the data types are implicit.
The private keyword is used to specify that the loop indices i and j are private to each thread.
The shared keyword is used to specify that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads.
The #pragma hip parallel for directive is used to parallelize the loop using HIP.
The loop indices i and j are declared as int, which is the default type for indices in C/C++.


Output 8:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real corresponds to float in C/C++. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double. Also, the hip pragmas are used to indicate parallelization, similar to OpenMP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler provided by AMD. You can then run the code on a GPU or CPU, depending on your system configuration.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP (for multi-threading on CPUs) for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used float as the data type, assuming single precision floating point numbers. If you need double precision, simply replace float with double.
Also, the HIP (for AMD GPUs) equivalent code would be:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

__global__ void spmv_parallel_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
  spmv_parallel_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
  hipDeviceSynchronize();
}
This HIP code assumes a NVIDIA GPU, if you have an AMD GPU, you should use the hip namespace instead of cuda and compile with the hipcc compiler.
Please note that you need to have the HIP and OpenMP libraries installed and configured on your system to compile and run this code.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is executed in parallel across blocks of threads, each of which computes a portion of the output vector y. The spmv_parallel function is a wrapper that launches the kernel and passes the necessary arguments.
Also, note that the code assumes that the input data is already allocated and copied to the GPU. You will need to add additional code to handle data transfer between the host and device if necessary.
You can use the following command to compile the code:
hipcc -arch <GPU_arch> spmv.cpp -o spmv
Replace <GPU_arch> with the architecture of your GPU (e.g. gfx900 for AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT).
