Output 1:
Translating the provided Fortran OpenMP code that implements a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation into its C/C++ equivalent involves several steps. Here is how you can do this:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double **a, int lda, double **b, int ldb, double beta, double **c, int ldc) {
    #pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) collapse(2)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i][l] * b[l][j];
            }
            c[i][j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```

Here is a breakdown of the C/C++ version:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `gemm_parallel` takes the same parameters as the Fortran subroutine, but the indices start from `0`, unlike Fortran where they start from `1`.

2. **OpenMP Parallel Directive**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) collapse(2)` is used to parallelize the outer two loops (`i` and `j` loops). `collapse(2)` allows the two loops to be merged into one, thus exposing more parallelism.
   
3. **Loop Variables**:
   - The loops iterate from `0` to `m-1` and `0` to `n-1` for `i` and `j` respectively, to match C/C++'s zero-based indexing.

4. **Matrix Indexing**:
   - The matrix access pattern `a[i][l]`, `b[l][j]`, and `c[i][j]` uses zero-based indexing.

5. **Local Variable**:
   - The `temp` variable is defined inside the nested loops, matching its scope with its usage.

6. **Matrix Multiplication and Accumulation**:
   - The computation inside the loops remains largely the same, translating directly into C/C++.

### Note:
- Ensure that the input matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are allocated appropriately and are passed correctly as double pointers (`double **`) or alternatively as flattened 1D arrays with appropriate index calculations if performance is very critical.
- For efficiency and to closely map to the typical way matrices are stored/accessed in C/C++, it might be better to use 1D arrays for the matrices with proper indexing (e.g., `a[i * lda + l]`).

Here is an alternative version using 1D arrays if required:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) collapse(2)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, `a`, `b`, and `c` are single-dimensional arrays, and appropriate indexing is performed with respect to `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`. This often maps more directly to the way memory is managed in C/C++ and can be more efficient due to better cache performance.

Output 2:
Below is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran GEMM operation using OpenMP for parallelization. The C/C++ code defines a function that matches the functionality provided by the Fortran code.

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;   // Example matrix dimensions
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;

    // Example matrices in column-major order (Fortran-like storage)
    double a[9] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 
                   4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 
                   7.0, 8.0, 9.0};  // m x k matrix
    
    double b[9] = {9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 
                   6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 
                   3.0, 2.0, 1.0};  // k x n matrix

    double c[9] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 
                   1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 
                   1.0, 1.0, 1.0};  // m x n result matrix

    int lda = k, ldb = n, ldc = n;

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);

    // Output the result
    printf("Resulting matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Storage Order**: The matrices are stored in column-major order, similar to Fortran, as indicated by the indexing in the loops (`i * lda + l` and `l * ldb + j`). This should be adjusted according to the actual storage order of your matrices if it's different (e.g., row-major for typical C/C++ usage).
2. **OpenMP Directives**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer `for` loop. The `private` clause makes sure that variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are private to each thread.
3. **Matrix Dimensions and Leading Dimensions**: The leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`) are used for indexing the matrices correctly following the storage order.

Make sure you have OpenMP enabled in your compiler. For example, using `gcc`, you would compile with the `-fopenmp` flag:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Output 3:
Certainly! Below is the corresponding C/C++ code with OpenMP to implement the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation as described in your Fortran code:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of gemm_parallel
    int m = 2, n = 3, k = 4;
    double alpha = 2.0, beta = 1.0;

    // Initialize matrices A, B, and C
    double a[2 * 4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
                       5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0};

    double b[4 * 3] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
                       4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
                       7.0, 8.0, 9.0,
                       10.0, 11.0, 12.0};

    double c[2 * 3] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                       0.0, 0.0, 0.0};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, 4, b, 3, beta, c, 3);

    // Print the result matrix C
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * 3 + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Parameters**:
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars for the GEMM operation.
   - `a`: Pointer to the matrix A of size `m x k` with leading dimension `lda`.
   - `b`: Pointer to the matrix B of size `k x n` with leading dimension `ldb`.
   - `c`: Pointer to the matrix C of size `m x n` with leading dimension `ldc`.

2. **Parallel Directive**:
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outermost loop. This is the equivalent of Fortran's `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` directive.

3. **Matrix Indexing**:
   - Matrix elements are accessed using column-major order (consistent with Fortran), using row-major adjustment in indexing for C/C++. For a matrix stored in column-major format in Fortran, the element at position `(i, j)` is accessed as `a[i + j*lda]`, but since we are dealing with C/C++ and assuming row-major, indexing here requires adjustment.

4. **Main Function**:
   - An example usage is provided with small matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`) are specified based on the respective matrix dimensions.

Make sure to compile the code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, e.g., using `gcc`:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
./gemm
```

This will produce the output matrix `c` as a result of the parallelized GEMM operation.

Output 4:
Below is a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenMP code that implements the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) collapse(2)
    for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for(int l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int m = 2, n = 2, k = 2;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[] = {1.0, 2.0,
                  3.0, 4.0};
    double b[] = {5.0, 6.0,
                  7.0, 8.0};
    double c[] = {9.0, 10.0,
                  11.0, 12.0};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, k, b, n, beta, c, n);

    printf("Resulting matrix C:\n");
    for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * n + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parameters:**
   - `m, n, k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha, beta`: Scalar multipliers.
   - `a, lda`: Matrix `A` and its leading dimension.
   - `b, ldb`: Matrix `B` and its leading dimension.
   - `c, ldc`: Matrix `C` and its leading dimension.

2. **OpenMP:**
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used for parallelizing the nested loops.
   - `collapse(2)` is used to flatten the nested loops into a single loop for better load balancing among threads.

3. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - `temp` accumulates the result of the multiplication of row `i` of matrix `A` with column `j` of matrix `B`.
   - Finally, `c[i * ldc + j]` is updated using the formula `alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j]`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Example matrices `A`, `B`, and `C` are provided along with dimensions and scalars.
   - The `gemm_parallel` function is called, and the resulting matrix `C` is printed.

Note that in C/C++, matrices are usually stored in row-major order, whereas in Fortran, they are stored in column-major order by default. Care should be taken in handling array indices accordingly.

Output 5:
Here is a version of the given Fortran OpenMP code implementing the GEMM operation, translated to C/C++ with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
            }
            c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The indices are adjusted to 0-based indexing which is the default in C/C++ as opposed to the 1-based indexing in Fortran.
- The Fortran `a(i, l)` is accessed as `a[i + l * lda]` in C/C++ to account for the multidimensional array indexing.
- We use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive instead of `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` for OpenMP parallelization in C/C++.
- `PRIVATE(i, j, l, temp)` corresponds to `private(i, j, l, temp)` in the OpenMP pragma.

This code should provide the same parallelized GEMM functionality as the original Fortran code. Make sure to compile with an appropriate flag like `-fopenmp` if you're using GCC or similar compilers to enable OpenMP. For example:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Output 6:
To convert the given Fortran OpenMP code into C/C++ OpenMP code, we need to follow the structure and logic provided, while ensuring we adhere to C/C++ syntax and best practices. The corresponding C/C++ code for the provided Fortran code is shown below:

### C/C++ Code with OpenMP

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**
   - In C/C++, the `double*` type is used for matrices, and the leading dimension parameters (lda, ldb, ldc) are used to properly access elements in these 1D arrays.
   - The function parameters are kept the same for simplicity.

2. **Indexing**
   - Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default, whereas C/C++ uses 0-based indexing. Hence, the loops start from `0` instead of `1`.
   - Matrix elements are accessed using row-major form where `a[i * lda + l]` computes the address of `a(i, l)` in Fortran.

3. **OpenMP Directives**
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `j`. The `private` clause ensures that variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are private to each thread.
   - The `schedule(static)` clause indicates that iterations are statically divided among threads. This mirrors the `SCHEDULE(STATIC)` in Fortran.

### Usage Example:

To call this function, you would define and fill your matrices in your main program and then call the `gemm_parallel` function with the appropriate parameters. Here's a simple example of how you might call `gemm_parallel` from a `main` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    double b[3][3] = {{9, 8, 7}, {6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1}};
    double c[3][3] = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}};
    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double*)a, lda, (double*)b, ldb, beta, (double*)c, ldc);

    printf("Result matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example shows the setup of matrices and the call to the `gemm_parallel` function. Adjust the sizes and contents of the matrices as required for your specific use case.

Output 7:
Sure! The analogous C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran subroutine would look something like this. Ensure you include the OpenMP header and enable OpenMP compilation in your compiler.

Here's the equivalent C/C++ code:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
            }
            c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
        }
    }
}
```

Here are some things to note:

1. In C/C++, arrays are 0-based, so the loops are indexed starting at 0 instead of 1.
2. Multi-dimensional arrays are generally stored in a flat format (row-major order by default), so you might need to convert the indexing `[i + l * lda]` and `[l + j * ldb]` to access the correct element.
3. OpenMP pragmas are used to provide parallel execution hints to the compiler.

To compile the code with OpenMP, you need to add the OpenMP flag to your compiler command. For example, using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This will enable OpenMP support in the resulting binary.

Output 8:
Sure, here is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenMP code that performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, 
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for(i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for(l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure to compile the code with OpenMP support, typically using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC or Clang:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

### Explanation:

- **Parameters:**
  - `m`, `n`, `k` are the dimensions of the matrices.
  - `alpha` and `beta` are scalar multipliers.
  - `a` is the \(m \times k\) matrix.
  - `b` is the \(k \times n\) matrix.
  - `c` is the \(m \times n\) resultant matrix (updated in-place).
  - `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are the leading dimensions of the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.

- **Direct Translation:**
  - The Fortran arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are converted to pointers in C, adjusting for zero-based indexing.
  - OpenMP parallelization syntax (`!$OMP PARALLEL DO` and `!$OMP END PARALLEL DO`) is translated to `#pragma omp parallel for`.

- **Matrix Access:**
  - Matrix elements are accessed as `a[i * lda + l]` instead of `a[i, l]` to account for C's row-major order and pointer arithmetic.

This code performs the GEMM operation in parallel, exploiting multiple threads as specified by the OpenMP environment settings.

Output 9:
Here's a version of the given Fortran OpenMP code implementing a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation in C/C++:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    // Parallelize the outermost loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Types and Function Signature:**
   - The subroutine has been converted to a `void` function in C/C++.
   - Integer and double types have been used to correspond to Fortran's `integer` and `real(kind=8)` types, respectively.

2. **Data Layout:**
   - In Fortran, matrices are stored in column-major order. In C/C++, matrices are typically stored in row-major order. Given the function's parameters, it assumes that `a`, `b`, and `c` are pointers to the first element of the matrices.

3. **OpenMP Parallelization:**
   - The `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` directive has been translated to `#pragma omp parallel for`.
   - The loops and variable scoping (`private`) have been appropriately adjusted for OpenMP in C/C++.

4. **Indexing:**
   - The Fortran code uses 1-based indexing, while C/C++ uses 0-based indexing. Adjustments have been made accordingly in the loops.

5. **Matrix Element Access:**
   - Matrix elements are accessed using pointer arithmetic, adjusted for row-major layout with strides defined by `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`.

By adhering to these principles, the provided C/C++ code effectively mirrors the Fortran code's functionality while leveraging OpenMP for parallelization.

Output 10:
Sure, here's a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenMP code for computing the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) 
{
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parameters**: 
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars for scaling.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: Pointers to matrices `A`, `B`, `C` respectively.
   - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of `A`, `B`, `C` respectively.

2. **OpenMP Directives**: 
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: Distributes the outer loop iterations across multiple threads.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)`: Each thread will have its own private copy of these variables.
   - `schedule(static)`: Divides the iterations into contiguous chunks.

3. **Indexing**: 
   - In Fortran, arrays are column-major, but in C/C++, arrays are row-major. Hence, indexing is adapted to `a[i * lda + l]`, `b[l * ldb + j]`, and `c[i * ldc + j]`.

Compile with:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
```

This will enable OpenMP support with GCC. Adjust compiler settings accordingly for other compilers.
