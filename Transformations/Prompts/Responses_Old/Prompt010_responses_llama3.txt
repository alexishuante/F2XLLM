Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If you need to use a different data type (e.g., float), you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the shared clause to specify that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads, and the private clause to specify that the loop indices i and j are private to each thread. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses in the OpenACC code.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own private copy of the arrays val, row, col, and x, while the lastprivate clause ensures that the final values of y are preserved across threads.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If you need to use a different data type, you can replace double with the appropriate type.
Also, the default(shared) clause in the OpenMP directive specifies that all variables are shared among threads, except for i and j which are declared as private to ensure each thread has its own copy.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the private clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own private copies of the loop indices i and j.


Output 5:
Here is a possible C/C++ OpenMP version of the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are of type double, and y is also of type double. If your data type is different, you can replace double with the appropriate type.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and default(none) to specify that each thread will have its own copy of the variables. The shared clause is used to specify which variables are shared among threads.
Please note that this is a possible conversion, and you may need to adjust it according to your specific use case.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If your data type is different (e.g., float or a custom type), you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
Also, keep in mind that OpenMP and OpenACC have different syntax and programming models, so the translation is not always one-to-one. However, this C/C++ OpenMP code should achieve the same parallelization and functionality as the original Fortran OpenACC code.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, and int for the row and col arrays. You may need to adjust the data types according to your specific use case.
Also, the default(shared) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to assume that all variables in the parallel region are shared among threads, unless specified otherwise. The private(i, j) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of the loop indices i and j.


Output 8:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, but you can adjust the types as needed. Also, I've used private(i, j) to ensure that each thread has its own copies of the loop indices, which is usually the safest approach.
To compile this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC or Clang, with the appropriate flag (e.g., -fopenmp for GCC).


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to make private copies of the arrays val, row, col, and x for each thread, and the lastprivate clause is used to make the final values of y visible to all threads.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point variables, as it is the default in C/C++. If you want to use float or any other type, you can replace double with the desired type.
Also, the default(none) clause is used to specify that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause is used to explicitly share the arrays val, row, col, x, and y among the threads. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT directives in OpenACC.
The parallel for directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the inner loop is executed sequentially by each thread.
