Output 1:
Here's a version of the Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation translated from Fortran with OpenACC to C/C++ with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV)
void gemv_parallel(int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int n = 3;
    float A[9] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f,
                  4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f,
                  7.0f, 8.0f, 9.0f};
    float x[3] = {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f};
    float y[3] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Declaration**: The function `gemv_parallel` takes the size `n`, the matrix `A` (flattened in row-major order), the input vector `x`, and the output vector `y`.
  
2. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop.
   - This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads, allowing for concurrent computation.

3. **Matrix Elements Access**:
   - The matrix `A` is accessed using the formula `A[i*n + j]` because it's stored in a 1D array. This makes the access pattern similar to 2D indexing `(i, j)`.

4. **Initialization and Sum Calculation**:
   - For each row `i`, initialize `sum` to `0.0f`.
   - Multiply the row elements of `A` with corresponding elements of vector `x`, accumulating the result in `sum`.
   - Store the calculated sum in the output vector `y` at position `i`.

5. **Main Function**:
   - Initializes the matrix `A` and vector `x`.
   - Calls the `gemv_parallel` function to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.
   - Prints the result stored in vector `y`.

The above code should work efficiently with multiple threads due to the parallel for loop provided by the OpenMP directive.

Output 2:
Sure, here is the equivalent C/C++ code for the Fortran OpenACC implementation using OpenMP. This code accomplishes a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float * __restrict A, const float * __restrict x, float * __restrict y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature:** 
   - Takes the matrix dimension `n`, matrix `A`, vector `x`, and output vector `y`.
   - The `__restrict` keyword is used to inform the compiler that the pointers `A`, `x`, and `y` are not aliased, which can help with optimization.

2. **OpenMP Parallel Loop:** 
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the OpenACC PARALLEL LOOP directive.
   - The `private(j)` clause ensures that each thread has its private instance of the loop variable `j`.
   - The `shared(A, x, y)` clause specifies that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.

3. **Loop Construction:**
   - The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix.
   - The inner loop iterates over the columns of the matrix to compute the dot product of the row of the matrix with the vector `x`.

4. **Matrix Access:**
   - The matrix `A` is accessed in a row-major order using `A[i * n + j]`, assuming `A` is a 1D array storing the 2D matrix.

### Usage:
You can use this function in a C/C++ program to perform matrix-vector multiplication in parallel. To compile this program with OpenMP, you need to include the `-fopenmp` (for GCC) or equivalent flag for your compiler:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c
```

This will enable the OpenMP directives and allow the parallel execution of the GEMV operation. Remember that OpenMP requires both a compiler and runtime support, so make sure your platform supports OpenMP.

Output 3:
Below is a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code that performs a Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation. This implementation uses OpenMP for parallelism.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float** A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;

        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }

        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Headers**: We include the `omp.h` header to use OpenMP directives.
- **Function Signature**: The function `gemv_parallel` takes the size of the matrix/vector `n`, a 2D array `A` representing the matrix, a 1D array `x` representing the vector, and a 1D array `y` which will hold the result of the matrix-vector multiplication.
- **OpenMP Parallel Directive**: `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop, which iterates over `i`. 
  - `private(i, j, sum)` specifies that each thread gets its own instance of these variables.
- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: Nested loops compute the matrix-vector product.

### Note:
- **Matrix A Representation**: The matrix `A` is assumed to be a 2D array of pointers (`float** A`). Depending on your application, you may need to adjust how `A` is allocated and accessed.
- **Indexing**: In C/C++, array indices start from 0, unlike Fortran where they start from 1. Therefore, the loops start from 0 and go to `n-1`.

Here's an example of how you might allocate and call this function in a C/C++ program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    float **A;
    float *x, *y;

    // Allocate memory for matrix A and vectors x and y
    A = (float**)malloc(n * sizeof(float*));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    }

    x = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    y = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize matrix A and vector x
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        x[i] = i + 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            A[i][j] = (i + 1) * (j + 1);
        }
    }

    // Perform matrix-vector multiplication
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result vector y
    printf("Result vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
```

This sample program demonstrates how to allocate memory for the matrix and vectors, initialize them, call the `gemv_parallel` function, and print the result. It also correctly frees the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

Output 4:
Sure, here is a C/C++ version using OpenMP to implement the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation corresponding to the given Fortran OpenACC code:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];  // Assuming A is stored in row-major order
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this code:
- We have added `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop `for (i = 0; i < n; i++)`.
- The `private` clause ensures `i`, `j`, and `sum` are private to each thread.
- The `shared` clause ensures `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.
- We assume that the matrix `A` is stored in row-major order in a 1D array.

To compile the program with OpenMP, you can use a command similar to the following (assuming the source file is named `gemv_parallel.c`):
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

This will link the OpenMP library and generate an executable named `gemv_parallel`.

Output 5:
Below is a C/C++ version of your Fortran OpenACC code using OpenMP for parallelism. OpenMP is a widely-used standard for parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran, allowing you to easily parallelize loops and other constructs.

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    float *A[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            A[i][j] = (float)(i + j);  // Example initialization
        }
    }

    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};  // Example vector x
    float y[n];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    printf("Result vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Parallel For**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop, distributing iterations of the loop across multiple threads. The `private(i, j, sum)` clause ensures each thread has its own private copy of these variables.
2. **Shared Data**: The `shared(A, x, y)` clause indicates that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.
3. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix `A` is dynamically allocated and initialized with example values. Ensure that `A` is properly deallocated after use to avoid memory leaks.
4. **Vector y**: The result vector `y` is computed and then printed out.

You will need to compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, you can compile with the following command:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

This command tells GCC to enable OpenMP with the `-fopenmp` flag and to output the compiled program as `gemv_parallel`.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is a C/C++ implementation of the Generalized Matrix-Vector multiplication (GEMV) using OpenMP for parallelism.

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV)
void gemv_parallel(int n, const float* A, const float* x, float* y) {
    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Interface**:
    - `n`: The size of the square matrix and the vectors.
    - `A`: Pointer to the 1D array representing the 2D matrix `A` of size `n x n`.
    - `x`: Pointer to the input vector `x` of size `n`.
    - `y`: Pointer to the output vector `y` of size `n`.

2. **Memory Layout**:
    - The matrix `A` is stored in a row-major order linear array. Thus, `A[i * n + j]` accesses the element at row `i` and column `j`.

3. **OpenMP Parallelism**:
    - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop over `i`. This means that different iterations of the loop will be executed concurrently by different threads.

4. **Inner Loop**:
    - The inner loop iterates over `j` to compute the dot product of the `i`-th row of matrix `A` and the vector `x`, storing the result in `sum`.

5. **Updating Result**:
    - Each thread independently computes and updates the `i`-th element of the result vector `y`.

### Notes:
- Ensure that OpenMP is enabled in your compiler by using the appropriate flags (e.g., `-fopenmp` for GCC).
- Using `float` for matrix and vectors for simplicity, modify it to `double` or any other type as required.
  
### Compilation:
To compile this code with OpenMP:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
```

For C++:
```sh
g++ -fopenmp gemv_parallel.cpp -o gemv_parallel
```

### Example Usage:

```cpp
int main() {
    int n = 4;
    float A[16] = { /* Initialize with some values */ };
    float x[4] = { /* Initialize with some values */ };
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print or Verify the result in y
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation ensures that the matrix-vector multiplication is done in parallel, efficiently utilizing the computational resources.

Output 7:
Sure, here's a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code using OpenMP to perform a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parameters**: The `gemv_parallel` function takes an integer `n`, which is the dimension of the matrix `A` and the vectors `x` and `y`. It also takes the matrix `A` (flattened as a 1D array), the input vector `x`, and the output vector `y`.

2. **OpenMP Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop (`for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)`). This directive distributes the loop iterations among the available threads.
    - `private(i, j, sum)`: Each thread gets its own copy of these variables.
    - `shared(A, x, y)`: These arrays are shared among all the threads.

3. **Loop Translation**:
    - The outer `do` loop in Fortran is replaced by a `for` loop in C/C++.
    - The inner `do` loop calculates the dot product of the `i`-th row of `A` with the vector `x`, storing the result in `sum`.

4. **Array Access**:
    - Since C/C++ uses row-major order for storing multi-dimensional arrays, the matrix `A` is accessed using `A[i * n + j]`, where `i * n` gives the starting index of the `i`-th row and `j` accesses the `j`-th column.

### Usage Example:
Here’s how you might call this function in a C/C++ program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y);

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    float A[16] = {1, 2, 3, 4,
                   5, 6, 7, 8,
                   9, 10, 11, 12,
                   13, 14, 15, 16};
    float x[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This would output the resulting vector `y` after the matrix-vector multiplication. Make sure to compile with the OpenMP flag, for example:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c
./gemv
```

This provides a parallelized GEMV operation using OpenMP in C/C++.

Output 8:
Sure, here's a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code using OpenMP to parallelize the Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]);

// Main function
int main() {
    int n = 4; // Example size of the matrix/vector
    float A[4][4] = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15, 16} };
    float x[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    float y[4];

    // Call the GEMV function
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result
    printf("Result vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Headers and Function Declaration**: The `#include <omp.h>` includes the OpenMP header for parallel functionality. The `gemv_parallel` function is declared before the `main` function.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Defines and initializes `n`, `A`, and `x`.
   - Calls `gemv_parallel` to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.
   - Prints the resulting vector `y`.

3. **gemv_parallel Function**:
   - Uses `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop over `i`.
   - `private(i, j)` ensures that each thread has its own private copy of `i` and `j`.
   - Inner loop computes the summation for each element of the result vector `y`.

This C/C++ version uses OpenMP pragmas to achieve parallelism similar to the original Fortran OpenACC code.

Output 9:
Sure, here's an equivalent GEMV operation using OpenMP in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const std::vector<std::vector<float>>& A, const std::vector<float>& x, std::vector<float>& y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

Here is a brief explanation:

1. **Include the necessary headers:** Since we are using `std::vector` for matrix and vector, we include the `<vector>` header.

2. **Function Signature:** The function `gemv_parallel` takes the size of the matrix `n`, matrix `A`, vector `x`, and vector `y`. 
   - The matrix `A` is represented as a 2D vector.
   - Vectors `x` and `y` are represented as 1D vectors.

3. **OpenMP pragma:**
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive tells the OpenMP runtime to parallelize the `for` loop that follows. Each iteration of the outer loop (`i`) will be executed in parallel by different threads.

4. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication:**
   - The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix `A`.
   - The inner loop performs the dot product of the `i`-th row of `A` and the vector `x`, accumulating the result in `sum`.
   - Finally, the result is stored in the `i`-th element of vector `y`.

Ensure that OpenMP is enabled during compilation. This can usually be done by passing the `-fopenmp` flag to the compiler, for example:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.cpp
```

This way, you can run the compiled program with OpenMP parallelization to perform the generalized matrix-vector multiplication.

Output 10:
Certainly! Below is an equivalent version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code implemented in C/C++ using OpenMP. This code performs a Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform GEMV operation using OpenMP
void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1000; // Example size of matrix and vectors
    double **A = (double **)malloc(n * sizeof(double *));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = (double *)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    }
    double *x = (double *)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = (double *)malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x with some values
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            A[i][j] = (i + j) * 0.01;
        }
        x[i] = i * 0.01;
    }

    // Perform GEMV operation
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print results for verification
    printf("Result vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `A` matrix and `x` and `y` vectors are dynamically allocated.
   - The elements of `A` and `x` are initialized with some values for demonstration purposes.
   
2. **Function `gemv_parallel`**:
   - It takes the size of the matrix/vector `n`, the matrix `A`, and the vectors `x` and `y`.
   - The outer loop is parallelized using the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive.
   - The `private(i, j, sum)` clause specifies that `i`, `j`, and `sum` are private to each thread.
   - The `shared(A, x, y)` clause specifies that `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.
   - Each thread calculates a portion of the results parallelly.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - After performing the GEMV operation, all dynamically allocated memory is freed to prevent memory leaks.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - The resulting vector `y` is printed for verification.
   
Before using OpenMP, make sure it is enabled for your compiler. For example, if you're using GCC, you can compile the code with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
```

Run the executable to see the results.
