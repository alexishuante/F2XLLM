Output 1:
Certainly! Here is a C/C++ version of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenMP, equivalent to the provided Fortran code:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <vector>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const std::vector<float>& val, const std::vector<int>& row, const std::vector<int>& col, const std::vector<float>& x, std::vector<float>& y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(int i, int j)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Parameters:**
   - `n` (number of rows) and `nnz` (number of non-zero elements).
   - `val` is a vector holding the non-zero values of the matrix.
   - `row` is a vector indicating the start of each row in `val`.
   - `col` is a vector giving the column index for each value in `val`.
   - `x` is the input vector to multiply.
   - `y` is the output vector where the result will be stored.

2. **OpenMP Directive:**
   - `#pragma omp parallel for` creates a parallel region where the loop iterations are divided among threads.
   - `default(none)` ensures all the variables must be explicitly shared or private.
   - `shared` clause specifies variables shared among all threads.
   - `private` clause specifies loop control variables to be private to each thread.

3. **The Loop:**
   - Outer loop iterates over all rows.
   - Inner loop accumulates the dot product of the sparse row `i` with the vector `x`.

### Notes:
- In C++, you typically initialize vectors using some STL container such as `std::vector` rather than raw arrays for better safety and ease of use. If you prefer raw arrays as in C, you can replace vectors with pointers and manage the memory manually.
- It is important to ensure that the vectors `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y` are appropriately sized before calling this function.

By using this code template, you should be able to perform the sparse matrix-vector multiplication in parallel using OpenMP with similar functionality to the provided Fortran code.

Output 2:
Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenMP code that performs Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV). The code assumes that the input matrix is stored in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format, similar to the Fortran code.

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <vector>

// Function to perform sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV)
void spmv_parallel(
    int n,              // Number of rows
    int nnz,            // Number of non-zero elements
    const std::vector<float> &val,  // Non-zero values
    const std::vector<int> &row,    // Row pointers
    const std::vector<int> &col,    // Column indices
    const std::vector<float> &x,    // Input vector
    std::vector<float> &y           // Output vector
) {
    // Ensure the output vector has the same size as the number of rows
    y.resize(n);
    
    // OpenMP parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage (you may replace it with actual data)
    int n = 5; // number of rows
    int nnz = 13; // number of non-zero elements
    std::vector<float> val = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130};
    std::vector<int> row = {0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 13};
    std::vector<int> col = {0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::vector<float> x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<float> y(n);
    
    // Call the SpMV function
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
    
    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << "y[" << i << "] = " << y[i] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this C/C++ version, we're using `std::vector` for managing dynamic arrays, which simplifies memory management and bounds checking. The `spmv_parallel` function uses OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop over the rows of the sparse matrix.

Key points to note:

1. Each thread computes one or more rows of the result vector `y`.
2. The nested loop iterates over non-zero elements in the current row, performing the multiplication and summing up the results.
3. OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop.

You can compile this program using a C++ compiler with OpenMP support, such as `g++`:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp spmv.cpp -o spmv
```

Run the compiled program to see the result of the SpMV operation. Adjust the matrix and vector data as needed for your specific use case.

Output 3:
Certainly! Here’s a version of the given Fortran OpenMP code that performs Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation, implemented in C/C++ with OpenMP:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function signature**: The routine `spmv_parallel` takes the following parameters:
   - `n`: the number of rows in the matrix.
   - `nnz`: the number of non-zero elements in the matrix.
   - `val`: an array of non-zero values in the sparse matrix.
   - `row`: an array where `row[i]` indicates the start of the non-zero values for row `i` in the `val` array.
   - `col`: an array where `col[j]` indicates the column index of the `j`-th non-zero value in the `val` array.
   - `x`: the input vector to be multiplied.
   - `y`: the output vector where the result will be stored.

2. **OpenMP parallel for**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop.
   - `default(none)`: Ensures that all variables need explicit data sharing attributes.
   - `shared(...)`: Specifies the variables that are shared among all threads.
   - `private(...)`: Specifies the loop indices as private since each thread needs its own copy.

3. **Loop indices**: The loops in C/C++ are zero-based, so they start from `0` instead of `1`.

4. **Inner computation**: For each row `i`, it initializes `y[i]` to `0.0` and sums the product of non-zero values and corresponding elements from `x` as defined by the column indices in `col`.

To compile the program with OpenMP support, you typically need to add the `-fopenmp` option for GCC (or the appropriate option for other compilers):

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv.cpp
```

### Usage Example:
Now, you can call `spmv_parallel` from your main function or any other function that prepares the input data appropriately.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    int nnz = 9;
    std::vector<float> val = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90};
    std::vector<int> row = {0, 3, 4, 7, 9};
    std::vector<int> col = {0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2};
    std::vector<float> x = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::vector<float> y(n, 0);

    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val.data(), row.data(), col.data(), x.data(), y.data());

    for (float result : y) {
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example initializes a small sparse matrix and vector, calls the parallel SpMV function, and prints the resulting vector.

Output 4:
Sure, below is a version of the given Fortran OpenMP code rewritten in C/C++ using OpenMP to implement the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation.

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Sparse matrix-vector multiplication
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Initialize y array to 0
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, row, val, col, x, y) 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Perform SpMV
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, row, val, col, x, y) private(i)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            #pragma omp atomic 
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    // Example data for testing (adjust sizes and values as needed)
    int n = 4;         // Number of rows/columns
    int nnz = 6;       // Number of non-zero elements

    float val[6] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};  // Non-zero values
    int row[5] = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6};               // Row pointer array
    int col[6] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3};          // Column indices

    float x[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};     // Input vector
    float y[4];                    // Result vector

    // Call the SpMV function
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
1. The array `y` is initialized to 0.0 in the outer parallel region.
2. Then, for each row `i`, the inner loop over the non-zero elements of the row is performed, and the results are accumulated into `y[i]`.
3. The `#pragma omp atomic` directive is used to ensure atomic updates to `y[i]`, which is necessary to avoid race conditions. 

Make sure to include `#include <omp.h>` to use the OpenMP directives and compile the code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler option, like `-fopenmp` for GCC.

Compile using:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv.c
```

Output 5:
Here's a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenMP code implementing the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) in parallel
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    // Parallel region with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    const int n = 5;
    const int nnz = 9;
    
    // Example data for sparse matrix A and vector x
    float val[9] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0};
    int row[6] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9};
    int col[9] = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 4};
    float x[5] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
    float y[5] = {0.0};
    
    // Perform Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication in parallel
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
    
    // Print the result vector y
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Prototype**: The `spmv_parallel` function is defined to perform the SpMV operation. It accepts:
    - `n`: Number of rows in the matrix.
    - `nnz`: Number of non-zero elements in the sparse matrix.
    - `val`: Array containing the non-zero values of the matrix.
    - `row`: Row pointers array.
    - `col`: Column indices array.
    - `x`: Input vector.
    - `y`: Result vector to store the matrix-vector multiplication result.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization**: The outer loop over the rows of the matrix is parallelized using the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. This ensures that different rows of the sparse matrix are processed in parallel.

3. **Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication Logic**: 
   - For each row `i` (in the range `[0, n)`), initialize `y[i]` to `0.0`.
   - Iterate over the non-zero elements in the current row (from `row[i]` to `row[i + 1]`).
   - Accumulate the product of the matrix element `val[j]` and the corresponding element from the vector `x[col[j]]` into `y[i]`.

4. **Main Function**: In the main function, example data for a sparse matrix and vector are provided. The `spmv_parallel` function is called, and the resulting vector is printed.

This code snippet can be compiled with an OpenMP-supporting compiler (like `g++` with the `-fopenmp` flag). Ensure there are no data races and that the input data is such that every parallel operation is independent.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran code for Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float val[], const int row[], const int col[], const float x[], float y[]) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function signature**:
   - The `spmv_parallel` function takes the following arguments:
     - `n`: Number of rows in the matrix.
     - `nnz`: Number of non-zero elements in the matrix.
     - `val`: Array containing the non-zero values of the matrix.
     - `row`: Array where `row[i]` is the index in `val` and `col` where the i-th row starts.
     - `col`: Array containing the column indices corresponding to the values in `val`.
     - `x`: Input vector.
     - `y`: Output vector.

2. **OpenMP parallel for**:
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The `default(none)` clause is used to enforce explicit data scoping, ensuring all variables are explicitly stated.
   - Shared variables (`shared`) are `n`, `nnz`, `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y`.
   - Private variables (`private`) are `i` and `j`.

3. **Initialization and computation within loop**:
   - For each row `i`, initialize `y[i]` to `0.0`.
   - Iterate over all non-zero elements in the i-th row (from `row[i]` to `row[i + 1] - 1`) and perform the matrix-vector multiplication: `y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]]`.

### Notes:

- In C/C++, array indexing starts from 0, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1. Therefore, the loop counters and array accesses are adjusted accordingly.
- Ensure that the OpenMP library and compiler flags (e.g., `-fopenmp` for GCC) are correctly set when compiling this code to enable parallel execution.

Output 7:
Certainly! Below is the C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenMP code that performs Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV):

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    // Parallel region with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f; // Initialize y[i] to zero
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]]; // Perform multiplication and add to y[i]
        }
    }
}
```

### Description and Conversion Notes:

1. **Loop Indices:** 
    - In Fortran, arrays are 1-based, but in C/C++, arrays are 0-based. Therefore, adjustments in loop indices (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`) are necessary to align with C/C++ conventions.
  
2. **Array Access:** 
    - Fortran uses `row(i)` and `col(j)`, while in C/C++ we use `row[i]` and `col[j]`.

3. **Data Types:** 
    - The `real` type in Fortran is mapped to `float` in C/C++. If `real` was meant to be `double` in Fortran, you would need to change `float` to `double` in C++.

4. **OpenMP Pragmas:**
    - Fortran uses `!$OMP PARALLEL DO ... !$OMP END PARALLEL DO`. The equivalent in C/C++ is `#pragma omp parallel for`.

5. **Initialization within Parallel Loop:**
    - `y[i]` is initialized to `0.0` inside the loop to avoid race conditions.

6. **Private Variables:**
    - In the C/C++ version, `i` and `j` are loop variables and are private by default in an OpenMP parallel for loop.

### Example Usage:
Here's a small example of how you might call this function, assuming `val`, `row`, `col`, and `x` arrays are appropriately defined and populated.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Function declaration
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y);

int main() {
    // Example sparse matrix of size 4 with 6 non-zero elements (values), represented in CSR format
    int n = 4;
    int nnz = 6;

    float val[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}; // Non-zero values
    int row[] = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6};           // Row pointers
    int col[] = {0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2};        // Column indices

    float x[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // Input vector
    float y[n];               // Output vector

    // Perform the SpMV operation
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
    
    // Print result
    std::cout << "Result vector y: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << y[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example initializes data, calls the `spmv_parallel` function, and prints the result vector `y`. Make sure to link with the OpenMP library during compilation (use the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC or Clang).

Output 8:
Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of your Fortran OpenMP code for performing a Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation. This is written using the C language syntax with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    // Parallel pragma for the outer loop.
    #pragma omp parallel for shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Note the following differences and points in the C/C++ code:
1. Array indexing in C/C++ starts from 0, in contrast to Fortran where it typically starts from 1 by default. This is taken into account in the loops.
2. The OpenMP directives in C use `#pragma omp` syntax.
3. Use `shared(...), private(...)` clauses to match the behavior of the Fortran code.

Make sure that the function is compiled with an OpenMP-enabled compiler using the appropriate flags (e.g., `-fopenmp` for `gcc` or `g++`). This will allow the parallel execution as indicated by the OpenMP pragmas.

Here is a basic example of compiling this code using `gcc` for a program which includes the function:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp spmv.c -o spmv
```

Make sure to link against the OpenMP library by using the appropriate compiler flags as shown.

Also, ensure to initialize the OpenMP library within the environment where you run the executable to make use of multiple threads.

Output 9:
Here is an equivalent C/C++ OpenMP version of the given Fortran OpenMP code for performing Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV). This code uses OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop in the `spmv_parallel` function, which corresponds to iterating over the rows of the matrix.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- `#include <omp.h>`: This includes the OpenMP header file.
- `void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y)`: This is the function declaration. It takes the same arguments as the Fortran subroutine with appropriate C/C++ types.
- `int i, j`: Loop indices, declared as per C/C++ syntax.
- `#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)`: This OpenMP directive parallelizes the for-loop that iterates over the rows of the sparse matrix. It specifies that `n`, `nnz`, `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y` are shared among threads, while `i` and `j` are private to each thread.
- The nested for-loop `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {...}` corresponds to iterating over each row of the matrix. For each row, the inner loop `for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {...}` accumulates the result of the matrix-vector multiplication for that row.

### Notes

1. **Indexing**: Note that C/C++ arrays are 0-based, while Fortran arrays are 1-based. The indices in the loop have been adjusted accordingly.
2. **Access Patterns**: Ensure the input arrays are correctly allocated and populated as per the CSR format of the sparse matrix.

You can compile this code with an OpenMP-compatible compiler by using the appropriate flag (e.g., `-fopenmp` for GCC).

### Compilation Example

To compile this code with GCC:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
```

This will produce an executable `spmv_parallel` which you can run with the appropriate input to perform the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication.

Output 10:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <vector>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const std::vector<float>& val, const std::vector<int>& row, const std::vector<int>& col, const std::vector<float>& x, std::vector<float>& y) {
    // Ensure the output vector y is sized correctly
    y.resize(n);

    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Headers and Namespace**: We include `<omp.h>` for OpenMP functionality and `<vector>` for the STL vector.
2. **Function Signature**: The function `spmv_parallel` takes the following parameters:
   - `n` (number of rows in the matrix),
   - `nnz` (number of non-zero elements),
   - `val` (vector of non-zero values),
   - `row` (vector that points to the start of each row in `val` and `col` arrays),
   - `col` (vector of column indices corresponding to `val`),
   - `x` (dense vector to be multiplied),
   - `y` (resultant dense vector, passed by reference to be output parameter).
3. **Resize Output Vector**: Ensure the output vector `y` is resized to match the number of rows `n`.
4. **OpenMP Parallel Region**:
   - Use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop over `i` (the rows of the sparse matrix).
   - The `default(none)` clause ensures that variables must be explicitly specified as shared or private.
   - Shared variables are the inputs and outputs (`n`, `nnz`, `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, `y`).
   - The outer loop index `i` and the inner loop index `j` are private by default.

The inner loop iterates over the range specified by the `row` array, performing the multiplication and accumulation of non-zero elements with the corresponding elements from the vector `x`.
