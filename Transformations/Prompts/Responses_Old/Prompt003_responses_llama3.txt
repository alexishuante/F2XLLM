Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the **A syntax is used to represent a 2D array, where each element is a pointer to a row of the matrix.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000; // size of the matrix
    double **A = new double*[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = new double[n];
    }
    double *x = new double[n];
    double *y = new double[n];

    // Initialize A and x with some values...

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y...

    // Clean up memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        delete[] A[i];
    }
    delete[] A;
    delete[] x;
    delete[] y;

    return 0;
}
This code uses dynamic memory allocation to create the matrix A and vectors x and y. Make sure to free the memory when you're done using it to avoid memory leaks.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the element at row i and column j.
You can also use std::vector and std::valarray to represent the matrices and vectors, which provides a more modern and safer way of handling dynamic arrays:
#include <vector>
#include <valarray>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const std::vector<float> &A, const std::valarray<float> &x, std::valarray<float> &y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
This version uses std::vector to represent the matrix A and std::valarray to represent the vectors x and y. The const keyword is used to indicate that the function does not modify the input arrays.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and multi-dimensional arrays are represented as a single block of memory. Therefore, the 2D array A is represented as a 1D array, and the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the element at row i and column j.
Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables j and sum are private to each thread, meaning that each thread will have its own copy of these variables.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, in the C/C++ version, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. If the array A is in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), the access should be changed to A[j * n + i].


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the element at row i and column j.
You can use this function in a C/C++ program as follows:
int main() {
    int n = 1000; // size of the matrix and vectors
    float *A = new float[n * n];
    float *x = new float[n];
    float *y = new float[n];

    // initialize A and x with some values
    // ...

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // use the result in y
    // ...

    delete[] A;
    delete[] x;
    delete[] y;

    return 0;
}
This code creates a matrix A and vectors x and y of size n, initializes them with some values, calls the gemv_parallel function to perform the matrix-vector multiplication, and then uses the result in y. Finally, it frees the memory allocated for the arrays.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is done as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
You can call this function by passing the dimensions of the matrix and vectors, and the pointers to the matrix and vectors, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float *A = new float[n * n];
    float *x = new float[n];
    float *y = new float[n];

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    delete[] A;
    delete[] x;
    delete[] y;

    return 0;
}
This code assumes that the matrix A and the vectors x and y are already allocated and initialized. The gemv_parallel function performs the matrix-vector multiplication in parallel using OpenMP, and the result is stored in the vector y.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the element at row i and column j is accessed as A[i * n + j].
You can also use std::vector instead of raw pointers for the arrays, and std::vector::data to get the pointer to the underlying array, like this:
void gemv_parallel(int n, std::vector<float> &A, std::vector<float> &x, std::vector<float> &y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A.data()[i * n + j] * x.data()[j];
        }
        y.data()[i] = sum;
    }
}
This way, you can use the benefits of std::vector (like automatic memory management) and still use OpenMP for parallelization.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the double **A notation is used to represent a 2D array, where each element is a pointer to a row of the matrix.
You can also use std::vector and std::vector<std::vector<double>> to represent dynamic arrays and 2D arrays respectively, which is a more modern and safer way to handle arrays in C++.
Here is the equivalent code using std::vector:
void gemv_parallel(int n, const std::vector<std::vector<double>> &A, const std::vector<double> &x, std::vector<double> &y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
This version is more safe and easier to use, as it prevents common errors like out-of-bounds access and memory leaks.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, whereas in Fortran, they are 1-indexed by default. Also, in C/C++, a 2D array is represented as a 1D array in row-major order, so A(i, j) in Fortran corresponds to A[i * n + j] in C/C++.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the double **A notation is used to represent a 2D array, where each element is a pointer to a row of the matrix.
You can also use std::vector and std::vector<std::vector<double>> to represent the matrix and vectors, respectively, which can provide better memory management and safety features:
void gemv_parallel(int n, std::vector<std::vector<double>> &A, std::vector<double> &x, std::vector<double> &y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Make sure to include the necessary headers (<vector> and <omp.h>) and compile with OpenMP support enabled.
