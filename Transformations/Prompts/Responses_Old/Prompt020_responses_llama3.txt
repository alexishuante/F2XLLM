Output 1:
Here is a possible C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C/C++. If you need to use double precision, you can replace float with double in the C/C++ code.
Also, the DEFAULT(PRESENT) clause in the Fortran code is replaced with present in the C/C++ code, which achieves the same effect of ensuring that the specified arrays are present on the accelerator device.
Similarly, the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses are replaced with present and copyout directives, respectively, to manage data movement between the host and device.
The rest of the code is straightforward, with the parallel loop and sparse matrix-vector multiplication implemented in a similar manner to the Fortran code.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the DEFAULT(PRESENT) clause in the Fortran code is not needed in C/C++ as the copyin and copyout clauses already imply that the arrays are present on the device.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc, using the -acc flag. For example:
pgcc -acc -o spmv spmv.c
This will generate an executable that can run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 3:
Here is a C/C++ version of the Fortran OpenACC code that implements a Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used float instead of real since C/C++ doesn't have a built-in real type. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C/C++, unlike Fortran which starts from 1. Additionally, the #pragma acc directive is used to specify the OpenACC parallel loop, and the default(present) clause is used to specify that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already present on the device.
You can also use the #pragma acc parallel loop gang directive to specify a gang of worker threads, and #pragma acc loop vector to specify a vector of iterations, like this:
#pragma acc parallel loop gang vector(128) default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
This will specify a gang of worker threads with 128 vectors, which can improve performance on devices that support vector instructions.
Also, you can use the #pragma acc cache directive to specify the cache policy for the arrays, like this:
#pragma acc cache(val, row, col, x, y)
This will specify that the arrays should be cached on the device.
You can also use the #pragma acc data directive to specify the data transfer policy, like this:
#pragma acc data present(val, row, col, x, y)
This will specify that the arrays are already present on the device, and no data transfer is needed.
Please note that the above code is a C/C++ version of the Fortran code, and it's not a direct translation. The Fortran code uses intent(in/out) to specify the direction of data transfer, which is not needed in C/C++. Also, the Fortran code uses a subroutine, which is not needed in C/C++.


Output 4:
Here is a possible implementation of the same SpMV operation in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used #pragma acc routine seq to ensure that the routine is executed sequentially on the device, which is typically the best approach for SpMV operations.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust it depending on your specific use case and requirements.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the default(present) clause tells the compiler to use the default data allocation and copy mechanisms for the listed arrays, and the copyin and copyout clauses specify which arrays to copy from host to device and from device to host, respectively.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the default(present) clause tells OpenACC to use the present table to determine the device and data allocation, and the copyin and copyout clauses specify the data to be copied to/from the device.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc++, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 7:
Here is a possible implementation of the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can easily modify the code to use double precision if needed.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the spmv_parallel function should be compiled for the accelerator, and the present clause to specify that the val, row, col, and x arrays are already present on the accelerator.
You can call this function from your host code, and the OpenACC runtime will take care of transferring the data to the accelerator and executing the kernel.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices have been adjusted to conform to C/C++ conventions (0-based indexing).


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the default(present) clause tells the compiler to use the default data allocation for any arrays that are not explicitly specified in the copyin or copyout clauses.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used float instead of real since C/C++ doesn't have a built-in real type. Also, I've changed the loop bounds to start from 0, as C/C++ arrays are 0-indexed, unlike Fortran which is 1-indexed. Additionally, I've used #pragma acc instead of !$ACC as the OpenACC directive syntax is different in C/C++ compared to Fortran.
