Output 1:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP, which is a GPU acceleration framework, equivalent to the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  
  hipLaunchKernel(gemm_parallel_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(1), 0, 0, m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
  
  hipDeviceSynchronize();
}

__global__ void gemm_parallel_kernel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  
  if (i < m && j < n) {
    double temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
This code uses HIP's hipLaunchKernel function to launch the gemm_parallel_kernel kernel on the GPU. The kernel is executed by multiple threads in parallel, each of which computes a subset of the elements of the resulting matrix c.
Note that this code assumes that the input matrices a, b, and c are stored in column-major order, as is typical in Fortran. If your matrices are stored in row-major order (as is typical in C and C++), you will need to modify the indexing in the kernel accordingly.
Also, this code uses the double type for the matrix elements, which corresponds to the real(kind=8) type in Fortran. If you need to use a different type (such as float or double complex), you will need to modify the code accordingly.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  hipLaunchKernel(gemm_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(1), 0, 0, m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}

__global__ void gemm_kernel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  if (i < m && j < n) {
    float temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the kernel is written in CUDA C++. The kernel is launched with a single block and a single thread, so the block and thread indices are not used. The gemm_parallel function is a wrapper that calls the kernel launch function.
Also, note that the data types and the intent of the variables are not explicitly specified in C++ as they are in Fortran. The float data type is assumed for the arrays a, b, and c, and the int data type is assumed for the indices m, n, k, lda, ldb, and ldc.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <hip/hip_complex.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note: This code assumes that the input matrices a, b, and c are already allocated and copied to the GPU device. You may need to add additional code to handle the memory management and data transfer between host and device.
Also, the HIP framework provides a hipLaunchKernel function to launch the kernel on the GPU, which is not shown in this example. You would need to wrap the parallel loop in a kernel function and launch it using hipLaunchKernel.
You can use the hipify tool to convert the OpenMP code to HIP code, which can generate the kernel launch code and memory management code for you.


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP (for AMD GPUs) that implements the same GEMM operation:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  float temp;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemm_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(m, n), 0, 0, m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}

__global__ void gemm_kernel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (i < m && j < n) {
    float temp = 0.0f;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the OpenMP parallel loop in the Fortran code, but uses CUDA-style thread indexing and synchronization.
You'll need to compile this code with the HIP compiler (hipcc) and link against the HIP runtime library (libhip.so) to run it on an AMD GPU.


Output 5:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  hipLaunchKernel(gemm_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(256), 0, 0, m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}

__global__ void gemm_kernel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tx;
  int stride_x = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;

  for (int j = ty; j < n; j += stride_x) {
    float temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[tx * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[tx * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[tx * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development framework that allows developers to write performance-portable code for various devices, including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
This code uses HIP's hipLaunchKernel function to launch the gemm_kernel kernel on the GPU. The kernel is executed in parallel by multiple threads, each of which computes a portion of the matrix product. The blockIdx and threadIdx variables are used to compute the global thread index, and the stride_x variable is used to compute the stride for the thread block.
Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may want to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP (for AMD GPUs) that implements the same Generalized Matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((gemm_kernel), dim3(1), dim3(1), 0, 0, m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}

__global__ void gemm_kernel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  if (i < m && j < n) {
    double temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the kernel is written in CUDA C++. The kernel is launched with a single block and a single thread, which is not optimal for performance. To achieve better performance, you would need to modify the kernel launch parameters and the kernel code to use multiple blocks and threads.
Also, note that this code assumes that the matrices a, b, and c are stored in device memory, and that the pointers a, b, and c are device pointers. You will need to modify the code to handle the data transfer between host and device memory if necessary.
You can use the following code to call the gemm_parallel function:
int main() {
  int m = 1024;
  int n = 1024;
  int k = 1024;
  double alpha = 1.0;
  double beta = 0.0;
  double *a, *b, *c;

  // Allocate device memory for matrices a, b, and c
  hipMalloc((void **)&a, m * k * sizeof(double));
  hipMalloc((void **)&b, k * n * sizeof(double));
  hipMalloc((void **)&c, m * n * sizeof(double));

  // Initialize matrices a and b
  // ...

  // Call the gemm_parallel function
  gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

  // Synchronize the device
  hipDeviceSynchronize();

  // Free device memory
  hipFree(a);
  hipFree(b);
  hipFree(c);

  return 0;
}
This code allocates device memory for the matrices a, b, and c, initializes the matrices a and b, calls the gemm_parallel function, and then frees the device memory. The hipDeviceSynchronize function is used to synchronize the device after the kernel launch.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <hip/hip_complex.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += hipDevicePtr(a)[i * lda + l] * hipDevicePtr(b)[l * ldb + j];
      }
      hipDevicePtr(c)[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * hipDevicePtr(c)[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note: In HIP, hipDevicePtr is used to access the device pointers. Also, the real(kind=8) type from Fortran is equivalent to double in C/C++.
To compile the code, you'll need to use a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc. Here's an example command:
hipcc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.cpp -fparse-hip -fhip-arch=gfx90a
This will generate a binary that can run on AMD GPUs.


Output 8:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP, a parallel programming framework for GPU acceleration:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  hipLaunchKernel(gemm_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(256), 0, 0, m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}

__global__ void gemm_kernel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  if (i < m && j < n) {
    double temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original Fortran code, but uses CUDA-style indexing and memory access patterns.
To compile this code, you would need to use a HIP-compatible compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler. You would also need to link against the HIP runtime library.
You can also use OpenMP with HIP to offload the computation to the GPU, here is an example:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      double temp = 0.0;
      for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
This code uses OpenMP's target directive to offload the computation to the GPU, and the teams and distribute directives to parallelize the computation across the GPU's processing elements.
Please note that this is a simplified example, you may need to add more code to handle memory allocation, data transfer and other details depending on your specific use case.


Output 9:

    } else {
      s_b[tx][ty] = 0.0;
    }

  }

  if (i < m && j < n) {
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
This code uses the HIP runtime to launch a kernel on the GPU, which performs the matrix multiplication. The kernel is launched with a 2D block size of 16x16, and each block is divided into smaller tiles to reduce global memory access.
Note that this is a simplified version of the code, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case. Additionally, this code assumes that the matrices are stored in column-major order, as is typical in Fortran.
Also, this code is a simple example of how to implement a GEMM operation in HIP, you may want to add more features like error checking, alignment, and data padding to make it more robust.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:

  // hipKernelLaunch is asynchronous, so we need to synchronize
  hipDeviceSynchronize();

    float temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to the CUDA runtime API, but is designed to work on multiple platforms, including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. The hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel, and the __global__ keyword is used to define the kernel function. The kernel function is similar to the OpenMP parallel loop, but uses CUDA-style threading and memory access.
Also, note that this code assumes that the matrices are stored in column-major order, which is the default for Fortran. If your matrices are stored in row-major order, you will need to adjust the indexing in the kernel function accordingly.
You can compile this code with the HIP compiler, hipcc, and run it on a GPU using the hipConfig and hipLaunchKernel functions. For example:
hipcc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.cpp
hipConfig --device 0 --blocks 1 --threads 256
hipLaunchKernel gemm_parallel 1 1 0 0 m n k alpha a lda b ldb beta c ldc
This will launch the kernel on the default GPU device with one block and 256 threads, and pass the arguments m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, and ldc to the kernel function.
