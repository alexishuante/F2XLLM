Output 1:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed a column-major ordering of the matrix A, as is typical in Fortran. Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Here's a brief explanation of the changes:
The #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine for the host CPU.
The #pragma acc parallel loop directive parallelizes the outer loop across the accelerator device (e.g., GPU).
The private(j, sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of the j and sum variables.
The #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive performs a reduction operation on the sum variable, adding up the contributions from all threads.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible way to implement GEMV in C/C++ using OpenACC. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to modify the code or add additional optimizations.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed a C/C++ style array representation where the matrix A is stored in row-major order, and the x and y vectors are stored as 1D arrays. Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed.
Here's a brief explanation of the OpenACC directives used:
#pragma acc routine seq: This directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine.
#pragma acc parallel loop gang vector: This directive parallelizes the outer loop across gangs (blocks of threads) and vectors (SIMD lanes).
#pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum): This directive performs a reduction on the sum variable across all threads in the team.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the specific implementation details may vary depending on the compiler and accelerator being used.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive performs a reduction on the sum variable.


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed A is a 1D array in C/C++ (i.e., A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j)), and I've used float instead of real since real is not a standard C/C++ type. Also, I've added #pragma acc routine seq to ensure the routine is executed sequentially on the host.
Also, please note that OpenACC is designed for parallelism on accelerators (GPUs, etc.), whereas OpenMP is designed for parallelism on multi-core CPUs. The translation is not always straightforward, and you may need to adjust the code to suit your specific use case.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that OpenACC is similar to OpenMP, but it is designed for parallel programming on accelerators such as GPUs. The #pragma acc directives are used to specify the parallel regions and data management.
Here's a brief explanation of the changes:
The subroutine is replaced with a C/C++ function.
The implicit none statement is not needed in C/C++.
The intent attributes are not needed in C/C++.
The array indices start from 0 in C/C++, so the loop counters are adjusted accordingly.
The private clause is replaced with the private attribute in the #pragma acc directive.
The reduction clause is used to specify the reduction operation on the sum variable.
This code assumes that the input matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as in Fortran), you may need to adjust the array indexing accordingly.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop private(j)
    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that OpenACC is similar to OpenMP, but it is designed for parallel programming on accelerators such as GPUs. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop, and the private clause specifies that the variables j and sum should be private to each thread.
Also, note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0, and the array access is modified accordingly.
You can also use OpenMP in C/C++ to parallelize the loop, it will look similar to OpenACC, but with OpenMP directives instead:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}

Output 7:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;

        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed a C-style array layout (row-major order) and used float as the data type, but you can easily modify the code to use double or other types as needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the routine should be compiled in sequential mode, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The gang vector clause is used to specify the parallelization strategy, and the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the exact syntax and semantics may vary depending on the compiler and architecture you're targeting.


Output 8:

    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive specifies that the inner loop is a reduction operation.


Output 9:

#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the gang vector parallelism, which is similar to the PARALLEL DO in OpenMP. The reduction clause is used to perform the sum reduction in parallel.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc++, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.
