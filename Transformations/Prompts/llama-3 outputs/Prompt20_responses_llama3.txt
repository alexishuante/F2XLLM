Output 1:
Here is a possible C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real corresponds to float in C/C++, and I've used the #pragma acc directive to specify the parallel loop and data management. Also, I've adjusted the loop indices to match C/C++ conventions (0-based indexing).
If you need a C++ version with classes, let me know!


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as int since they are used as indices for arrays.
The #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the default(present) clause tells the compiler to use the default data allocation and management for the arrays. The copyin and copyout clauses specify which arrays to copy from the host to the device and back, respectively.
You can use this code in a C/C++ program and compile it with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as GCC or PGI, to run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices are adjusted to conform to C/C++ conventions (0-based indexing).


Output 4:
Here is a possible implementation of the SpMV operation in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can easily modify the code to use double or other precisions as needed. Also, I've used the #pragma acc directive to specify the OpenACC parallel loop, which is similar to the !$ACC directive used in Fortran.
In this implementation, the default(present) clause tells OpenACC to use the default device (e.g., GPU) if it's present, and the copyin and copyout clauses specify which arrays to copy to/from the device. The parallel loop clause specifies the loop that should be parallelized.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices in C/C++ are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a SpMV operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real is equivalent to float in C/C++. If you need to use double, simply replace float with double in the code.
Also, please note that the array indices in C/C++ start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a SpMV operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the default(present) clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that the compiler will automatically determine the best way to map the data to the accelerator.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the default(present) clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to assume that all variables are present on the device, unless specified otherwise.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, and int for the row and col arrays. You can modify the data types as needed.
Also, the default(present) clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to assume that the arrays val, row, col, and x are present on the GPU, and to copy them to the GPU if necessary. The copyout(y) clause specifies that the y array should be copied back to the host after the computation is complete.
You can use this code as a starting point and optimize it further based on your specific use case.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the routine seq directive is used to tell the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used on the host or device.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the compiler will generate the parallel code based on the directives. The code above is a C/C++ version of the original Fortran code, but the parallelization is done using OpenACC directives.
