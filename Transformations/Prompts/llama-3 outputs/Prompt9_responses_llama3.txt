Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, whereas in Fortran, they start at 1. Also, the default(none) clause is used to specify that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause is used to specify the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the type for val, x, and y, but you can change it to the appropriate type if needed. Also, the loop indices are adjusted to match C/C++ conventions (0-based indexing).


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to the appropriate type if needed. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as int since they are used as indices for arrays.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is the default real type in C/C++. If you need to use a different type (e.g., float), you can replace double with the appropriate type.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the type for val, x, and y, but you can change it to the appropriate type if needed. Also, the loop indices are adjusted to match C/C++ conventions (0-based indexing).


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the type for val, x, and y, but you can change it to the appropriate type if needed. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as int, which should be appropriate for most cases. Let me know if you need any further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is the default floating-point type in C/C++. If you need to use a different type (e.g., float or long double), you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel do since the loop is a parallel for loop. The default(none) clause specifies that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause lists the arrays that are shared among the threads. The private clause lists the indices i and j, which are private to each thread.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If your application requires a different data type (e.g., float or long double), you can modify the code accordingly.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've used C-style arrays and pointers, as C++ does not have built-in support for Fortran-style arrays. Also, I've changed the loop indices to start from 0, as C/C++ arrays are 0-indexed, unlike Fortran which is 1-indexed.
Additionally, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel do as the loop is a for loop, not a do loop.
Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance!


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, the loop indices are adjusted to match C/C++ conventions (0-based indexing).
