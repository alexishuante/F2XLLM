Output 1:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

  // GEMVKernel
  __global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
      sum = 0.0;
      for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
      }
      y[i] = sum;
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original Fortran code, but uses C/C++ syntax and indexing.
Also, note that this is a basic implementation and you may want to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.
You can call this function from your C/C++ code like this:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;

  // Allocate memory on the host
  A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
  x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize data on the host
  // ...

  // Transfer data to the device
  float *d_A, *d_x, *d_y;
  hipMalloc((void **)&d_A, n * n * sizeof(float));
  hipMalloc((void **)&d_x, n * sizeof(float));
  hipMalloc((void **)&d_y, n * sizeof(float));
  hipMemcpy(d_A, A, n * n * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
  hipMemcpy(d_x, x, n * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Call the kernel
  gemv_parallel(n, d_A, d_x, d_y);

  // Transfer result back to the host
  hipMemcpy(y, d_y, n * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Free memory on the device
  hipFree(d_A);
  hipFree(d_x);
  hipFree(d_y);

  // Free memory on the host
  free(A);
  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory on the host and device, initializes the data on the host, transfers it to the device, calls the kernel, transfers the result back to the host, and frees the memory on both the host and device.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: HIP (HIP Infrastructure for Portable acceleration) is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for GPU computing. It allows developers to write performance-portable applications for various types of accelerators, including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
Also, the above code assumes that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C++. If your matrix is stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you would need to transpose the indices in the kernel.


Output 3:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is launched with a single block of n threads, and each thread computes a single element of the output vector y.
Also, note that the matrix A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, as is typical in C++. If your matrix is stored in column-major order (as is typical in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing in the kernel function accordingly.
You can compile this code with a command like hipcc -o gemv gemv.cpp, and run it with a command like ./gemv <n> <A_file> <x_file> <y_file>. The input files should contain the matrix A and vector x in binary format, and the output file will contain the resulting vector y.


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernelGGL((gemv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development framework that allows developers to create portable applications for various devices, including GPUs and CPUs.
This code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the device (GPU or CPU) that performs the GEMV operation. The gemv_kernel function is executed in parallel by multiple threads on the device, each computing a partial result for a row of the matrix A. The results are stored in the array y.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) and run it on a device that supports HIP (such as an AMD GPU or CPU).


Output 5:
Here is a version of the code you provided, but in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is launched with a single block of n threads, and each thread computes one row of the output vector y.
Also, note that this is a simple implementation and you may want to add error checking and handling, as well as optimize the kernel for better performance.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is launched with a block size of 1, and a grid size equal to the size of the vector y.
Also, the data types are assumed to be float, if you want to use double precision, you need to change the data type to double and the kernel function will be launched with double precision.
You can compile this code with the HIP compiler (hipcc) and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Please let me know if you need more help.


Output 7:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is written in CUDA C++ and performs the GEMV operation in parallel.
Also, note that the code assumes that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C++. If your Fortran code uses column-major order, you'll need to transpose the matrix before passing it to this function.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP (HIP is similar to OpenACC, but for AMD GPUs):
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed the real type from Fortran corresponds to float in C/C++. If you want to use double precision, simply replace all occurrences of float with double.
Also, I've used the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The gemv_kernel function is executed in parallel by multiple threads on the GPU, each computing a single row of the matrix-vector product.
Make sure to compile with the HIP compiler (hipcc) and link with the HIP runtime library (-lhip_runtime) to run this code on an AMD GPU.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: This code uses HIP, which is a C++ runtime API, and the kernel is written in CUDA C++. The hipLaunchKernel function is used to launch the kernel on the GPU. The GEMVKernel kernel is executed in parallel on the GPU, with each thread computing a single element of the output vector y.
Also, note that this is a simple implementation and may not be optimized for performance. In a real-world scenario, you would want to optimize the kernel for memory access patterns, use shared memory, and other techniques to achieve better performance.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original Fortran code, but uses C-style indexing and pointer arithmetic to access the matrix and vector elements.
Also, note that this is a simple example and you may want to add error checking and other features depending on your specific use case.
