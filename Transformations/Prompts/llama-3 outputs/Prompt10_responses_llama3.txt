Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the lastprivate clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the y array, which is necessary since each thread is updating its own portion of the array.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If your data type is different, you can replace double with the appropriate type.
Also, I've used firstprivate to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the input arrays val, row, col, and x, and lastprivate to ensure that the output array y is properly updated and visible to all threads after the parallel loop.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the arrays val, row, col, and x, while the lastprivate clause is used to ensure that the final values of y are preserved across all threads.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the arrays val, row, col, and x, while the lastprivate clause is used to ensure that the final values of y are visible outside the parallel region.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to make private copies of the arrays val, row, col, and x for each thread, and the lastprivate clause is used to make the final values of y visible to all threads.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the arrays val, x, and y, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the firstprivate clause in OpenMP is used to make private copies of the arrays val, row, col, and x for each thread, which is equivalent to the COPYIN clause in OpenACC.
Keep in mind that OpenMP and OpenACC have different syntax and programming models, so the translation is not always one-to-one. However, this code should give you a good starting point for implementing SpMV with OpenMP.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to make private copies of the arrays val, row, col, and x for each thread, and the lastprivate clause is used to make the final values of y visible to all threads.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the firstprivate clause is used to make private copies of the arrays val, row, col, and x for each thread, and the lastprivate clause is used to make the final values of y visible to all threads.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the private clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own private copies of the loop indices i and j. The default(shared) clause specifies that all variables not explicitly listed are shared among threads.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) firstprivate(val, row, col, x) lastprivate(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with the appropriate type (double or others) as needed. Also, the lastprivate clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the y array, which is necessary since OpenMP doesn't have a direct equivalent to OpenACC's COPYOUT clause.
