Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, which represent the leading dimensions of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively. Also, the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {

      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the a, b, and c arrays, respectively, using the row-major ordering convention.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;

                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the a, b, and c arrays, respectively, using the row-major ordering convention.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, since C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with custom leading dimensions like Fortran does.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {

      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, whereas in Fortran, they are 1-indexed. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c respectively, since C/C++ uses row-major ordering.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {

      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, which represent the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, since C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with arbitrary leading dimensions like Fortran does.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to calculate the correct memory addresses for the 2D arrays a, b, and c.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed row-major storage for the matrices, which is the default in C/C++. If your matrices are in column-major storage (as in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly. Also, I've replaced real(kind=8) with double, which is the equivalent type in C/C++.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, since C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with flexible dimensions like Fortran does.
