Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated explicitly using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, as C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with adjustable bounds like Fortran does.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;

      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated explicitly using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, as C/C++ does not have built-in support for Fortran-style array indexing.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, whereas in Fortran, they start at 1. Also, the array access is done using pointer arithmetic instead of the Fortran style array access. The #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback or for debugging purposes. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive parallelizes the loop using OpenACC.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the a, b, and c arrays, respectively, using the row-major ordering convention.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, const double *a, int lda, const double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array accesses are done using the pointer notation a[i * lda + l] instead of the Fortran-style a(i, l).


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda and ldb parameters. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, and the private clause is used to specify the private variables for each thread.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {

      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, as C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with arbitrary leading dimensions like Fortran does.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;

  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, as C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with arbitrary leading dimensions like Fortran does.
I used double as the type for the arrays, assuming that's what real(kind=8) corresponds to in your Fortran code. If that's not the case, you can change it to the appropriate type.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, whereas in Fortran, they start at 1. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively, since C/C++ uses row-major ordering.
I used #pragma acc routine seq to ensure that the routine is executed sequentially on the host, and #pragma acc parallel loop to parallelize the loops on the device. The collapse(2) clause collapses the two inner loops into a single loop, and the private clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of the variables i, j, l, and temp.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the syntax is different from Fortran. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc arguments are used to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c respectively, since C/C++ does not have implicit array bounds like Fortran.
I used double as the type for the arrays and scalars, assuming that's what real(kind=8) corresponds to in your Fortran code. If that's not the case, you can change it to the appropriate type.
