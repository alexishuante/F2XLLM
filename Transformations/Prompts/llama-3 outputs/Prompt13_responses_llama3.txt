Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop seq
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as NVIDIA's nvcc or GNU's g++ with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
nvcc -fopenacc (link unavailable) -o gemv_parallel
Or
g++ -fopenacc gemv_parallel.cpp -o gemv_parallel
This code will offload the computation to a GPU, if available, using OpenACC directives.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {

        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as GCC or PGI, with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
gcc -fopenacc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable that can run on a GPU or other accelerator device supported by the OpenACC platform.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }

    }
}

To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as GCC or PGI, with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
gcc -fopenacc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc kernels loop independent
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as row-major (i.e., the row index varies most quickly), whereas in Fortran, arrays are typically column-major (i.e., the column index varies most quickly). Therefore, the array access A(i, j) in Fortran corresponds to A[i * n + j] in C/C++.
Also, OpenACC uses #pragma acc kernels to specify the parallel kernel, and #pragma acc loop to specify the parallel loop. The independent clause is used to indicate that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently, and the reduction clause is used to perform a reduction operation (in this case, summing the elements of the array).
You can use OpenACC libraries such as OpenACC API or libaccpm to compile and run this code on a GPU or other accelerator.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed A is a 1D array in C/C++ (as it's a contiguous block of memory), so I've used A[i * n + j] to access the element at row i and column j. Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the private clause in OpenACC is not needed in this case, as the sum variable is already private to each thread. The reduction clause is used to perform the sum reduction on the sum variable.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 7:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and array indices are 0-based, so the code has been adjusted accordingly. Also, the routine seq directive is used to indicate that the gemv_parallel function should be compiled in sequential mode, and the parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The reduction(+:sum) clause is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.
You can also use the following OpenACC directives to specify the device and data management:
#pragma acc data copy(A, x, y)
#pragma acc kernels loop
This will copy the arrays A, x, and y to the device and perform the computation on the device.
You can also use the following OpenACC directive to specify the number of gangs, workers and vectors:
#pragma acc kernels loop gang(num_gangs) worker(num_workers) vector(num_vectors)
This will allow you to tune the performance of the application by adjusting the number of gangs, workers and vectors.
It's important to note that the OpenACC standard is supported by several compilers, including the PGI compiler, the Cray compiler, and the GNU compiler.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive performs the reduction operation on the sum variable.
To compile this code, you would need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc from the PGI compiler suite or gcc with the OpenACC plugin. The compilation command would be something like:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This would compile the code for execution on an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:

Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent private(sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop independent directive tells the compiler that the iterations of the outer loop can be executed independently, while the private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable. The reduction(+:sum) clause performs the reduction operation on the sum variable.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.
You can also use #pragma acc parallel loop instead of #pragma acc kernels loop if your compiler supports it. This will allow the compiler to parallelize the loop automatically, without the need for explicit kernel launches.
