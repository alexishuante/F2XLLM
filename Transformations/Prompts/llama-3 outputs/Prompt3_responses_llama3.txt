Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the private clause is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copies of the variables j and sum.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }

}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the variables j and sum.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the double **A notation is used to represent a 2D array, where each element is a pointer to a row of the matrix.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the element at row i and column j.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the variables j and sum.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMV (General Matrix-Vector) operation:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, unlike in Fortran where they are 1-indexed. Also, the double **A notation is used to represent a 2D array, where A[i][j] corresponds to A(i, j) in Fortran.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop counters start at 0 and go up to n-1. Also, in the C/C++ version, I assumed double as the data type, but you can change it to float or any other type as needed. Additionally, I used the const keyword to indicate that the function does not modify the A, x, and n parameters.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the double **A notation is used to represent a 2D array, where each element is a pointer to a row of the matrix.
You can also use std::vector to represent dynamic arrays, and std::vector<std::vector<double>> to represent a 2D array. Here is an example:
void gemv_parallel(int n, std::vector<std::vector<double>> &A, std::vector<double> &x, std::vector<double> &y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
This version is more modern and idiomatic C++, but it requires including the <vector> header and using std::vector instead of raw arrays.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the ** notation is used to represent a 2D array, where each element is a pointer to a row of the matrix.
You can also use std::vector and std::valarray to represent matrices and vectors, respectively, which can provide better memory management and performance. Here's an example using std::vector:
#include <vector>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const std::vector<std::vector<double>> &A,
                   const std::vector<double> &x, std::vector<double> &y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
This version uses const references to avoid unnecessary copies of the input matrices and vectors.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and matrix indexing is done manually using the row-major ordering (as opposed to Fortran's column-major ordering). Also, the private clause in OpenMP is used to specify variables that are private to each thread, similar to the private keyword in Fortran OpenMP.
