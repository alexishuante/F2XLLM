Output 1:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API and the __global__ keyword to define a kernel that executes on the GPU. The hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel on the GPU. The kernel function spmv_kernel performs the same computation as the original Fortran OpenACC code.
Also, note that this is a CUDA-like version, you need to adjust the compilation and execution commands to use HIP instead of CUDA.
You can use the following command to compile the code:
hipcc -o spmv spmv.cpp
And the following command to run the code:
./spmv
You can also use the HIP runtime API to copy data between host and device, and to synchronize the device.
hipMemcpy(d_val, val, nnz * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(d_row, row, (n+1) * sizeof(int), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(d_col, col, nnz * sizeof(int), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(d_x, x, n * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);

hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, d_val, d_row, d_col, d_x, d_y);

hipMemcpy(y, d_y, n * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);
You need to allocate memory on the device using hipMalloc and free it using hipFree when you're done with it.
float *d_val, *d_x, *d_y;
int *d_row, *d_col;

hipMalloc((void **)&d_val, nnz * sizeof(float));
hipMalloc((void **)&d_row, (n+1) * sizeof(int));
hipMalloc((void **)&d_col, nnz * sizeof(int));
hipMalloc((void **)&d_x, n * sizeof(float));
hipMalloc((void **)&d_y, n * sizeof(float));
You can also use the hipDeviceSynchronize() function to synchronize the device after launching the kernel.
hipDeviceSynchronize();
Please note that this is a basic example, you may need to add error checking and handling, and also optimize the code for your specific use case.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The spmv_kernel function is executed in parallel by multiple threads on the GPU, each computing a portion of the result. The blockIdx.x and threadIdx.x variables are used to compute the global thread index i, which is used to access the appropriate elements of the arrays.
Also, note that the hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel, which is a HIP-specific function. The dim3 variables specify the block and grid dimensions for the kernel launch.
You will need to compile this code with a HIP-compatible compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and link against the HIP runtime library.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

  hipLaunchKernelGGL(
    (void *)spmv_kernel, 
    dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, 
    n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y
  );
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {

  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development framework that allows developers to write performance-portable code for various devices, including GPUs and CPUs.
This code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the device, which performs the SpMV operation in parallel. The kernel function spmv_kernel is executed by multiple threads on the device, each handling a portion of the computation.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) and run it on a device that supports HIP (such as an AMD GPU).


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]-1; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for developing portable applications on various platforms, including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
This code uses the HIP kernel launch syntax to launch the spmv_kernel kernel on the GPU. The kernel performs the same sparse matrix-vector multiplication as the original Fortran OpenACC code.
Please note that this is a simplified example, you may need to add error checking and other features depending on your specific use case.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The spmv_kernel function is executed in parallel on the GPU, with each thread handling a single row of the sparse matrix. The HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function.
Also, note that this code assumes that the val, row, col, x, and y arrays are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You may need to add additional code to handle the memory management and data transfer between the host and device.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(256), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[idx]; j < row[idx+1]-1; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[idx] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel function spmv_kernel is executed in parallel by multiple threads, each computing a portion of the sparse matrix-vector product.
You'll need to compile this code with a HIP-compatible compiler (such as hipcc) and link against the HIP runtime library.
Also, you can use hipify tool to convert OpenACC code to HIP code, it will do the heavy lifting for you.
hipify --convert --platform=amd --openacc spmv_parallel.f90
This will generate the equivalent HIP code for the given OpenACC code.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime and assumes that the data is already allocated on the device. You may need to modify the code to handle data transfer between host and device depending on your specific use case.
Also, you can use HIP's cooperative groups to parallelize the kernel launch, which would be equivalent to the OpenACC PARALLEL LOOP directive. Here's an example:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y, hipCGScopeThreadGroup);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
  __syncthreads();
}
This will launch the kernel in parallel using cooperative groups, which allows for more flexible parallelization and synchronization.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to the OpenACC API. The hipLaunchKernelGGL function launches the spmv_kernel kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU. The kernel itself is similar to the OpenACC loop, with the main difference being the use of CUDA-style indexing and memory access.
Also, note that this is a HIP kernel, which can run on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, whereas OpenACC is more focused on NVIDIA GPUs.
You can also use HIP library which provides a high-level API for sparse matrix operations, including SpMV.
#include <hip/sparse.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipsparseHandle_t handle;
  hipsparseCreate(&handle);
  hipsparseSpmv(handle, nnz, val, row, col, x, y, n);
  hipsparseDestroy(handle);
}
This way you don't need to write your own kernel and it will be taken care by the HIP library.


Output 9:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated to C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]-1; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows you to run kernels on AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, as well as CPUs. The HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function, and the hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel. The kernel function spmv_kernel is defined with the __global__ keyword, which indicates that it should be executed on the device.
Also, note that the code assumes that the input arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already allocated and copied to the device. You will need to add additional code to perform these operations before calling the spmv_parallel function.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler, and run it on a supported device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP:

  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for programming GPUs and other devices. It is similar to OpenACC, but focused on GPU acceleration.
This code uses the HIP runtime to launch a kernel (a function that runs on the GPU) that performs the SpMV operation in parallel. The kernel is launched with n blocks, each containing one thread. Each thread computes the dot product of a row of the sparse matrix with the input vector x and stores the result in the output vector y.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler (such as the HIP-clang compiler) and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
