Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, and the #pragma acc directives are used to specify the parallelism and data management. The gang vector clause specifies the parallelization strategy, and the private clause specifies the variables that are private to each gang. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the temp variable.
Also, note that the array indexing is different in C/C++ compared to Fortran, so the array accesses are modified accordingly.
You can call this function by passing the appropriate arguments, such as:
int m = 100;
int n = 100;
int k = 100;
double alpha = 1.0;
double beta = 1.0;
double *a = (double *)malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
double *b = (double *)malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
double *c = (double *)malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

// Initialize the arrays a, b, and c

gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);
Make sure to include the OpenACC header file (#include <openacc.h>) and compile the code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler (such as PGI or GCC) to enable the parallelization.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the array names in the Fortran code (e.g. a, b, c) become pointers in the C/C++ code. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the arrays in the C/C++ code.
The #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the gemm_parallel function, which can be used as a fallback when OpenACC is not enabled.
The #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector directive parallelizes the outer two loops (over j and i) using gangs and vectors, which are the OpenACC equivalent of OpenMP threads and SIMD lanes, respectively. The private clause specifies that each gang and vector should have its own private copies of the variables i, j, l, and temp.
The #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) directive performs a reduction on the variable temp using the + operator, which is equivalent to the OpenMP reduction(+:temp) clause.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array accesses are done using the * operator instead of ().
The #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The private clause specifies that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread. The collapse(2) clause tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop.
The #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) directive specifies that the variable temp is a reduction variable, and the + operator is used to combine the values from each thread.
You can compile this code using a C/C++ compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, float alpha, float *a, int lda, float *b, int ldb, float beta, float *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  float temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) is equivalent to float in C/C++. If your compiler supports double or long double types, you may want to use those instead.
Also, OpenACC's gang vector parallelism is equivalent to OpenMP's PARALLEL DO with SCHEDULE(STATIC). The reduction clause is used to perform the sum reduction in the inner loop.
Lastly, the routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine for the host CPU. You can remove this directive if you only want to run the code on the GPU.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, whereas in Fortran, they are 1-indexed. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenACC directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
Also, the private clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the variables i, j, l, and temp, which is necessary for parallelization.
You can also use OpenACC kernels directive to parallelize the loop, it will look like this:
#pragma acc kernels loop private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
You can also use OpenACC gang and worker directives to parallelize the loop, it will look like this:
#pragma acc parallel loop gang private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
#pragma acc loop worker
You can choose the best approach based on your specific use case and hardware architecture.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, I've used the gang vector parallelism in OpenACC to parallelize the outer loops, and reduction clause to perform the reduction on the temp variable.
You can adjust the pragmas according to your needs and the specific OpenACC implementation you're using.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l) present(a, b, c)
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      double temp = 0.0;
      for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, I've used the present clause in the OpenACC directive to ensure that the arrays a, b, and c are present on the GPU.
You can use this function like this:
int m = 1024;
int n = 1024;
int k = 1024;
double alpha = 1.0;
double beta = 1.0;
double *a = (double *)malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
double *b = (double *)malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
double *c = (double *)malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

// Initialize a, b, and c

#pragma acc data copyin(a[0:m*k], b[0:k*n], c[0:m*n])
gemma_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);
#pragma acc data delete(a, b, c)
This code allocates memory for the matrices a, b, and c on the host, initializes them, and then copies them to the GPU using the acc data directive. The gemma_parallel function is then called, and the results are copied back to the host. Finally, the memory on the GPU is deleted using the delete clause.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) is equivalent to double in C/C++. Also, I've used gang vector parallelism in OpenACC to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the PARALLEL DO directive in OpenMP. The reduction clause is used to parallelize the inner product reduction.
To compile, use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI or GCC, with the appropriate flags (e.g., -acc for PGI, -fopenacc for GCC).


Output 9:
Here is a version of the code in C++ using OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      double temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the intent of the original Fortran code was to perform a general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation, and I've adjusted the indexing accordingly. Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to indicate that the loops should be parallelized, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive to specify that the temp variable should be reduced across threads.
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the exact syntax and semantics may vary depending on the compiler and platform you're using.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the 2D arrays a, b, and c in column-major order, as in Fortran.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI or GCC. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.
