Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0,
    n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows you to run kernels on AMD GPUs. The spmv_kernel function is executed in parallel on the GPU, with each thread block processing a portion of the input data.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a system with an AMD GPU.
Also, note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, if your data is in double precision, you need to change the type to double and the kernel will be launched with double precision.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for developing portable, high-performance applications on modern heterogeneous compute devices.
Also, the HIP kernel is launched using hipLaunchKernelGGL which is a HIP runtime API. The HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function.
This code assumes that the HIP runtime API is initialized and the necessary memory allocations and data transfers have been performed.


Output 3:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can change this to double if needed. Also, I've used the hip compiler directives to parallelize the loop using HIP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a HIP-enabled compiler such as hipcc. You can then run the code on a GPU using the hipLaunchKernel function.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]-1; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the OpenMP loop in the original Fortran code, but uses CUDA-style indexing and memory access patterns.
Also, note that HIP is a portable runtime API that can run on multiple platforms, including NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and CPUs. To use HIP, you'll need to install the HIP runtime library and compile your code with the HIP compiler.


Output 5:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The spmv_kernel function is executed in parallel on the GPU, with each thread handling a single row of the sparse matrix.
Also, note that this code assumes that the input arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You will need to add additional code to handle memory allocation and data transfer between host and device.
You can use the hipMalloc and hipMemcpy functions to allocate memory on the GPU and copy data from host to device, respectively. For example:
float *val_d, *x_d, *y_d;
int *row_d, *col_d;

// Allocate memory on GPU
hipMalloc((void **)&val_d, nnz * sizeof(float));
hipMalloc((void **)&row_d, (n+1) * sizeof(int));
hipMalloc((void **)&col_d, nnz * sizeof(int));
hipMalloc((void **)&x_d, n * sizeof(float));
hipMalloc((void **)&y_d, n * sizeof(float));

// Copy data from host to device
hipMemcpy(val_d, val, nnz * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(row_d, row, (n+1) * sizeof(int), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(col_d, col, nnz * sizeof(int), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
hipMemcpy(x_d, x, n * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyHostToDevice);
You will also need to modify the spmv_parallel function to pass the device pointers to the kernel launch function. For example:
hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val_d, row_d, col_d, x_d, y_d);
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the int type is used for the indices, but you may want to consider using size_t for larger matrices.
To compile this code with HIP, you'll need to use a compiler that supports HIP, such as the AMD ROCm compiler. Here's an example command:
hipcc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.cpp -fopenmp
This will generate a binary that can be run on an AMD GPU.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP kernel launch API to launch the spmv_kernel kernel on the GPU. The kernel is launched with n blocks, each containing one thread. The spmv_kernel function performs the same computation as the original Fortran OpenMP code.
Also, note that the HIP kernel uses the __global__ keyword to indicate that it is a kernel that runs on the GPU, and the blockIdx.x and threadIdx.x variables to compute the global thread index.
You can compile this code with the HIP compiler (hipcc) and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 8:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original OpenMP code, but uses CUDA-like syntax and indexing to access the arrays.
You will need to compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and link against the HIP runtime library. You can then run the code on a GPU that supports HIP.
Also, note that this is a simple example, you may want to add more features like error checking, data transfer between host and device, etc.


Output 9:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the hip pragmas are used to indicate parallelization, similar to OpenMP.
Keep in mind that this code is for HIP, which is a GPU acceleration framework, so it will run on AMD GPUs. If you want to run it on NVIDIA GPUs, you'll need to use a different framework like CUDA. Let me know if you need help with that!


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code you provided, converted to C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma hip parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real corresponds to float in C/C++, and I've used the HIP pragma for parallelization. Also, the loop indices now start from 0 (instead of 1) to match C/C++ conventions.
Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
