Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(n, nnz, val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause in the OpenACC directive is used to copy the input arrays from the host to the device, and the copy clause is used to copy the output array y from the device to the host.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(n, nnz, val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause is used to copy the input arrays to the device, and the copy clause is used to copy the output array y back to the host.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to add additional compiler flags to enable OpenACC support. For example, with GCC, you can use the -fopenacc flag.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) operation:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used #pragma acc directives to specify the parallelization and data management for the OpenACC implementation. The copyin clause copies the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the accelerator, while the copy clause copies the output array y back to the host. The reduction(+:y[i]) clause ensures that the partial sums of y[i] are properly combined across threads.
Also, I've used float instead of real as the type for the arrays, since float is the typical type used in C/C++ for floating-point numbers. If you need to use a different type (e.g., double), you can modify the code accordingly.
Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(n, nnz, val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that the necessary data is copied to the device (GPU) and the copy clause for the y array ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
To compile, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, with the appropriate flags (e.g., -fopenacc for GCC).


Output 5:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays are present on the device (GPU) before executing the loop.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to add additional flags or options to enable OpenACC support.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop seq
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used gang vector parallelism in OpenACC, which is similar to the parallel do directive in OpenMP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as the PGI compiler or the NVIDIA HPC SDK compiler. You may also need to add additional flags or options to enable OpenACC support.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC version of the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a SpMV operation:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop gang
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C/C++. If you need to use double precision, you can replace float with double and adjust the #pragma acc directives accordingly.
Also, keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, similar to OpenMP. The #pragma acc directives inform the compiler about the parallelization and data management for the accelerator device.
Please let me know if you need further assistance!


Output 8:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector present(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C/C++. If you're using double precision, you can replace float with double in the C/C++ code.
Also, the present clause in the OpenACC directive tells the compiler that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already present on the GPU, so it doesn't need to copy them.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as GCC or PGI, using the -fopenacc flag. For example:
gcc -fopenacc spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable that can run on a GPU.


Output 9:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used copyin to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and copy to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the partial sums of y[i].
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as GCC or PGI, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector) operation:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the copyin clause is used to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and the copy clause is used to copy the output array y from the device to the host.
Here's a brief explanation of the OpenACC directives used:
#pragma acc parallel loop: Specifies that the following loop should be parallelized.
copyin(val, row, col, x): Copies the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device.
copy(y): Copies the output array y from the device to the host.
#pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]): Specifies that the reduction operation += should be performed on the array y element-wise.
Note that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, and the compiler will generate the necessary code to execute the parallel loop on the device (e.g., GPU).
