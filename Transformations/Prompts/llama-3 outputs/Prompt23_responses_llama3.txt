Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C++ code using HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the OpenMP parallel loop in the Fortran code, but uses CUDA-like threading and indexing to parallelize the computation.
Also, note that this is a simplified example and you may need to add error checking and other features depending on your specific use case.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the OpenMP loop in the original Fortran code, but uses CUDA-style indexing and memory access patterns.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Also, you can use hipMalloc and hipMemcpy to allocate and copy memory on the GPU, and hipFree to free the memory when it's no longer needed.
For example:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;
  hipMalloc((void **)&A, n * n * sizeof(float));
  hipMalloc((void **)&x, n * sizeof(float));
  hipMalloc((void **)&y, n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize A and x

  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

  // Synchronize and check for errors

  hipFree(A);
  hipFree(x);
  hipFree(y);

  return 0;
}
You can also use hipEvent to measure the execution time of the kernel, and hipDeviceSynchronize to synchronize the device before measuring the execution time.
hipEvent_t start, stop;
hipEventCreate(&start);
hipEventCreate(&stop);
hipEventRecord(start, 0);

gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

hipEventRecord(stop, 0);
hipEventSynchronize(stop);

float milliseconds = 0;
hipEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
Please note that this is a basic example, you may need to optimize the kernel and memory access pattern to achieve the best performance on your specific hardware.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C++ code using HIP:

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the OpenMP parallel loop in the Fortran code, but uses CUDA-style indexing and memory access patterns.
Also, note that this is a very basic implementation and you may want to add error checking, data transfer between host and device, and optimization for memory access patterns depending on your specific use case.
You can use the hipcc compiler to compile this code and run it on a GPU.


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows for GPU acceleration. The gemv_parallel function launches a HIP kernel, gemv_kernel, which performs the GEMV operation in parallel on the GPU.
Also, I've assumed that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C++. If your matrix is stored in column-major order (as in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing in the kernel accordingly.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) and run it on a GPU-supported device.

Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original Fortran code, but uses C++ syntax and indexing.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Also, you can use hipMalloc to allocate memory on the GPU and hipMemcpy to copy data between host and device.
You can also use hipGetDeviceCount to get the number of available GPUs and hipDeviceSelect to select which GPU to use.

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;

You can use hipcpp to parallelize the code, and it will take care of the underlying HIP runtime API calls.


Output 8:

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: This code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to OpenMP but for GPU acceleration. The hipLaunchKernel function launches the GEMVKernel kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU. The kernel is launched with a single block and n threads, where each thread computes a single row of the matrix-vector product.
Also, note that this code assumes a column-major storage format for the matrix A, which is the default in Fortran. If your matrix is stored in row-major format, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.


Output 9:

}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is launched with a single block of n threads, and each thread computes a single element of the output vector y.
Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may want to add error checking and handling, and also you might want to optimize the kernel for your specific use case.
You can also use HIP cu++ wrapper to compile this code to run on GPU.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    sum = 0.0;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is launched with a block size of 1 and a grid size of n, so each block processes one row of the matrix A. The sum variable is private to each thread, and the A and x arrays are accessed using global memory indices.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Also, you can use HIP's OpenMP-like parallelization feature, called HIP-OMP, to parallelize the kernel launch. Here's an example:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <hip/hip_omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma hip omp parallel for private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
This code uses the #pragma hip omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loop launch, and the private clause to specify that the j and sum variables are private to each thread. The HIP-OMP runtime will take care of launching the kernel on the GPU and parallelizing the loop iterations across the GPU threads.
