Output 1:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with CUDA:
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (m * n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the CUDA programming model to parallelize the GEMM operation on a GPU. The gemm_parallel function launches a kernel on the GPU, which is executed by multiple threads in parallel. Each thread computes a subset of the output elements, using shared memory to store temporary results.
You'll need to compile this code with the CUDA compiler (nvcc) and link against the CUDA runtime library (-lcudart). You can then call the gemm_parallel function from your C/C++ code to perform the GEMM operation on the GPU.
Also, note that this is a simple implementation of GEMM on GPU, you may want to consider optimizing the memory access pattern, using shared memory, and optimizing the block size and grid size for your specific use case.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ with CUDA code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) operation:
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int blockSize = 16;
  int numBlocks = (m + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
  gemm_parallel_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}

__global__ void gemm_parallel_kernel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {

  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  if (i < m && j < n) {
    double temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
      temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the CUDA programming model to parallelize the GEMM operation on a NVIDIA GPU. The gemm_parallel function launches a CUDA kernel, gemm_parallel_kernel, which performs the actual computation. The kernel is executed by a 2D grid of blocks, each containing a 2D array of threads. Each thread computes a single element of the output matrix c.
Also, note that the memory layout of the matrices a, b, and c is assumed to be column-major, as in the Fortran code. If your matrices are stored in row-major order, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
You can compile this code with nvcc and link it with your favorite BLAS library to get a fully functional GEMM implementation.


Output 3:

  if (col < n && row < m) {
    double temp = 0.0;
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {

    }
    c[row * ldc + col] = alpha * temp + beta * c[row * ldc + col];
  }
}
Note that this code uses the CUDA programming model to parallelize the GEMM operation on a NVIDIA GPU. The gemm_parallel function launches a kernel on the GPU, which is executed by multiple threads in parallel. Each thread computes a subset of the resulting matrix elements.
Also, this code assumes that the input matrices a and b are stored in column-major order, which is the default for Fortran. If your matrices are stored in row-major order (as in C), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.

    }
    c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
  }
}
Note that this implementation assumes that the matrices a, b, and c are stored in column-major order, which is the default in Fortran. Also, the cudaDeviceSynchronize() call is used to wait for the kernel to finish execution before returning from the gemm_parallel function.
You'll need to compile this code with the CUDA compiler (nvcc) and link it with the CUDA runtime library ((link unavailable)). You can do this using the following command:
nvcc -arch=sm_52 -o gemm_parallel (link unavailable) -lcudart
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run on your GPU.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Also, note that the memory layout of the matrices a, b, and c is assumed to be column-major, as in Fortran. If your matrices are in row-major layout (as in C), you'll need to adjust the indexing in the kernel accordingly.
You can call this function from your C/C++ code like this:

if (err != cudaSuccess) {

cudaFree(c);
This code allocates memory for the matrices a, b, and c on the GPU, initializes them with some data, calls the gemm_parallel function, and then frees the memory. The cudaDeviceSynchronize function is used to wait for the kernel to finish execution, and the cudaGetLastError function is used to check for any errors that may have occurred during kernel execution.

Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may want to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.

Also, note that this code uses the double data type for the matrix elements, which corresponds to the real(kind=8) type in Fortran. If you want to use a different data type (e.g. float), you can modify the code accordingly.
You'll need to compile this code with the CUDA compiler (nvcc) and link it with the CUDA runtime library ((link unavailable)). You can then call the gemm_parallel function from your host code to perform the GEMM operation on the GPU.
