Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, and the private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0, not 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is done as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the following loop, which is equivalent to the !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in OpenACC.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop. Each thread will be assigned a different iteration of the loop, and the results will be combined at the end.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum) 
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, whereas in Fortran, they are 1-indexed by default. Also, in the C/C++ code, I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells the compiler to parallelize the following for loop using OpenMP. The private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, in the C/C++ version, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(const int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop counters start at 0 and go up to n-1. Also, in the C/C++ code, I assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double if needed.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(const int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as 1-D arrays, so we need to manually calculate the index for the 2-D array A. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C/C++, whereas in Fortran, they start from 1 by default.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are represented as pointers, and array indices start from 0. Also, the omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in OpenACC.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the variables i and sum.
Please note that this code assumes that the 2D array A is represented as an array of pointers to arrays (i.e., double **A). If your representation is different, the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.
Also, error checking and other features may need to be added depending on the specific requirements of your application.
