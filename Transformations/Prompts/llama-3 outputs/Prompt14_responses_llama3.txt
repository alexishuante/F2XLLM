Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accelerator.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so we adjust the loop bounds and array indexing accordingly. Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to specify that the sum variable is a reduction variable, which allows the compiler to safely parallelize the inner loop.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on a device that supports OpenACC (such as an NVIDIA GPU).


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop seq
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the elements.
The #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be called from a parallel region. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive parallelizes the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop seq directive ensures that the inner loop is executed sequentially.
You can use this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize A and x

    #pragma acc data copy(A, x, y)
    {
        #pragma acc parallel
        {
            gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
        }
    }

    // Use the result in y

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the arrays A, x, and y, initializes them, and then calls the gemv_parallel function in a parallel region using OpenACC. The #pragma acc data copy directive copies the data to the device and back.


Output 3:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and array indices are calculated manually. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C/C++, as variables are explicitly declared. Additionally, the real type is equivalent to float in C/C++.
I used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed.
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop. The acc loop directive is not strictly necessary in this case, but it can be useful for more complex kernels.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is done accordingly. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in Fortran.
You can also use C++ syntax for the loop and array indexing, which might be more familiar to C++ developers:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Or, using modern C++ features:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
All of these versions should be equivalent and produce the same result as the original Fortran code.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMV (General Matrix-Vector) operation:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start from 0, so the loop counters and array indices are adjusted accordingly. Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is added to the inner loop to ensure that the partial sums are correctly combined across threads.
Also, you can use #pragma acc parallel loop gang instead of #pragma acc parallel loop to specify the parallelism on the gang level, which can be more efficient for large datasets.
You can also use #pragma acc parallel loop vector to specify the parallelism on the vector level, which can be more efficient for small datasets.
You can also use #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector to specify the parallelism on both gang and vector levels, which can be more efficient for medium-sized datasets.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, we use pointers to arrays instead of arrays themselves, and we use float instead of real (which is not a standard C/C++ type). Also, the loop reduction clause is used to specify that the sum variable is being reduced (i.e., summed) across the parallel iterations.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a GEMV (General Matrix-Vector) operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the routine should be compiled in sequential mode, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The inner loop is also parallelized using the #pragma acc loop directive.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so we adjust the loop bounds and array indexing accordingly. Also, the implicit none statement in Fortran is not needed in C/C++, as variables are explicitly declared. Finally, the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C/C++. If you want to use double precision, you can replace float with double.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
You can use this function in a C/C++ program, and compile it with a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, to take advantage of parallel acceleration on a GPU or other accelerator.
