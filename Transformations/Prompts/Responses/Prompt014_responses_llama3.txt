--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrix is stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type that suits your needs.
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the exact syntax and features may vary depending on the compiler and accelerator you're using.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc kernels
    {
        #pragma acc loop independent
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
            for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
            }
            y[i] = sum;
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to manually handle array indexing, unlike in Fortran where it's handled automatically. Also, we use #pragma acc kernels to indicate the parallel region, and #pragma acc loop independent to specify that the outer loop can be parallelized. The reduction clause is used to ensure that the summation is correctly parallelized.
Please note that this code assumes that the input matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrix is stored in column-major order (like in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc kernels
  {
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
      for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
      }
      y[i] = sum;
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to indicate that the loop should be executed on the accelerator, and #pragma acc loop independent to indicate that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently. The #pragma acc loop reduction directive is used to perform a reduction operation (in this case, a sum) in parallel.
Please note that you may need to adjust the OpenACC directives and the memory management to match your specific use case.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if you need double precision.
You'll need to compile this code with a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if you need double precision.
You'll need to compile this code with a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, and link with the Accelerate library.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays, with the matrix stored in row-major order (i.e., A[i * n + j] is the element at row i and column j). Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify that the loop should be executed on the accelerator, and loop independent to indicate that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently.
Keep in mind that you may need to modify the function to match your specific use case, such as adding data transfer directives (#pragma acc data) if the arrays are not already present on the accelerator.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays, with the matrix stored in row-major order (i.e., A[i * n + j] is the element at row i and column j). Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels loop independent directive to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) to perform a reduction on the sum variable.
Please note that this code is a direct translation of the provided Fortran code and might need to be adjusted based on the actual memory layout and data types used in your application.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to specify the parallel loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive is used to specify the loop that can be parallelized.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING feature:
use iso_c_binding

interface
  subroutine gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(c_int), value :: n
    real(c_float) :: A(n, n)
    real(c_float) :: x(n)
    real(c_float) :: y(n)
  end subroutine gemv_parallel
end interface

...
call gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y)
...
Make sure to compile your Fortran code with the -c flag and link it with the C object file generated from the OpenACC C code.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to explicitly specify the array indices using A[i * n + j] since C stores arrays in row-major order, whereas Fortran stores arrays in column-major order. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, whereas they start from 1 in Fortran.
Also, make sure to compile with the -acc flag to enable OpenACC support.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to manually handle the memory layout of the 2D array A by multiplying the row index i by the number of columns n to get the correct index. Also, we use the reduction(+:sum) clause to specify that the sum variable is a reduction variable, which allows the compiler to generate correct code for parallel execution.
Also, I assume that the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays in C, with the matrix A stored in row-major order. If your matrices are stored in column-major order, you would need to swap the indices in the inner loop.
