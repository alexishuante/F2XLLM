Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in the C version, I assumed that the arrays a, b, and c are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. Also, I used double as the data type, which corresponds to real(kind=8) in Fortran.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as GCC or PGI, with the -acc flag. For example:
gcc -acc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate a parallel version of the GEMM operation that can be executed on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    #pragma acc loop vector
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran is equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used the gang vector parallelism in OpenACC to parallelize the outer loop, and vector parallelism for the middle loop. The innermost loop is sequential (seq) as it has dependencies between iterations.
Please let me know if you need any further assistance!


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Please note that OpenACC and OpenMP are used for parallelization on accelerators and multi-core CPUs, respectively. The code assumes a column-major storage of matrices, similar to Fortran. The array indices in the C code are adjusted accordingly.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to adjust the indexing accordingly. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization. The reduction(+:temp) clause is used to perform a reduction on the temp variable.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate a parallel executable that can run on a GPU or other accelerator.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in OpenACC, the gang and vector clauses are used to parallelize the loop across multiple GPUs and threads, respectively. The private clause is used to declare variables that are private to each thread, and the reduction clause is used to perform a reduction operation on the temp variable.
Also, note that the array indices are calculated differently in C than in Fortran, so the indexing in the C code is adjusted accordingly.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    #pragma acc loop gang vector
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in the OpenACC version, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to ensure that the routine is executed sequentially on the device, and the #pragma acc loop directives are used to parallelize the loops. In the OpenMP version, the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the loops, and the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two outer loops into a single parallel loop.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector collapse(2) private(temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used gang vector collapse to parallelize the outer two loops, and reduction to parallelize the inner loop.
To compile, use:
gcc -o gemm_parallel -acc gemm_parallel.c
You can then call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module. Let me know if you need help with that!


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda and ldb parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a and b respectively. Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) directive is used to perform the reduction operation on the temp variable.
As for the OpenACC directives, #pragma acc parallel loop is used to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop is used to parallelize the inner loop. The private clause is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread, and the reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the temp variable.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the reduction clause is used to parallelize the inner loop and avoid race conditions.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
or
pgcc -ta=nvidia -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector collapse(2) present(a, b, c)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used the gang vector collapse clause to parallelize the loop over i and j, and the reduction clause to parallelize the summation over l.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI or GCC. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -Minfo=accel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate an executable that runs on an NVIDIA GPU.
