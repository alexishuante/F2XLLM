Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accelerator.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and array indices are calculated manually using the pointer and the index. Also, the #pragma acc loop directive is used to indicate that the inner loop should be parallelized as well.
Also, the const keyword is used to indicate that the function does not modify the n, A, and x parameters.
You can use this function as follows:
int main() {
  const int n = 1024;
  float *A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
  float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize A and x

  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

  free(A);
  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the matrices A and vectors x and y, initializes them (not shown in this example), calls the gemv_parallel function, and then frees the memory.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the index calculation A(i, j) becomes A[i * n + j]. The reduction(+:sum) clause is used to parallelize the inner loop, which performs the dot product of a row of A with x.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and multidimensional arrays are represented as pointers to pointers. The #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the gemv_parallel function should be compiled for the host CPU, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The inner loop is also parallelized using the #pragma acc loop directive.
Also, note that the array indexing is different in C/C++ compared to Fortran. In C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, whereas in Fortran, they are 1-indexed. Therefore, the loop indices and array indices have been adjusted accordingly.
You can use this code in your C/C++ program, and compile it with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as GCC or PGI, to take advantage of GPU acceleration.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be a 1D array with n * n elements, and the row-major ordering is used to access its elements.
You can use this function in your C/C++ program to perform the GEMV operation. Make sure to include the OpenACC header file (#include <accel.h>) and compile your program with the OpenACC compiler flags to enable OpenACC support.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be a 1D array stored in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
You can use this function in your C/C++ code like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024; // example size
    float *A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code assumes that the OpenACC compiler and runtime are set up correctly to compile and run the parallelized code on the GPU.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so we adjust the loop bounds and array indexing accordingly. Also, we use float as the data type, but you can change it to double or other types as needed. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is accessed in row-major order, as is typical in C/C++. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the element at row i and column j.
To compile this code, you would need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, and specify the -fopenacc flag. For example:
gcc -fopenacc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.
