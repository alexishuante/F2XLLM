Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is commonly used in scientific computing. If your application uses float precision, simply replace double with float in the code.
Also, I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified arrays are shared among threads, which is a good practice to avoid unintended data sharing.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val, x, and y are arrays of double values, and row and col are arrays of int values. Also, I've used default(none) to specify that no variables are shared by default, and then explicitly listed the shared variables using shared(val, row, col, x, y).
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is commonly used in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the types accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and specified default(shared) to ensure that all arrays are shared among threads. The private(i, j) clause is used to declare private copies of the loop indices for each thread.
You can call this function in your C program, passing in the appropriate arrays and sizes. Make sure to link with the OpenMP library (-fopenmp flag for GCC) to enable parallel execution.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is commonly used in scientific computing. Also, the default(shared) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that all variables are shared among threads, except for the private variables i and j which are each thread's own copy.
To compile this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC or Clang, with the appropriate flag (e.g., -fopenmp for GCC).


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the default(shared) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that all variables are shared among threads, except for the private variables i and j which are each thread's own copy.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you're using a different precision, you can adjust the types accordingly.
Also, I've used default(none) to specify that no variables are shared by default, and then explicitly listed the shared variables using shared(val, row, col, x, y). This is a good practice to avoid accidental sharing of variables.
You can call this function in your C program like this:
int main() {
  int n = 1000; // number of rows
  int nnz = 10000; // number of non-zero elements
  double *val = malloc(nnz * sizeof(double));
  int *row = malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int));
  int *col = malloc(nnz * sizeof(int));
  double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
  double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

  // Initialize val, row, col, and x arrays...

  spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

  // Use the resulting y array...

  free(val);
  free(row);
  free(col);
  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)

    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified arrays are shared among threads. Also, the loop indices are adjusted to match C's 0-based indexing.
To compile, use:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
To use OpenMP, you'll need to link against the OpenMP library (-fopenmp flag).


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {

    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If your application uses a different precision, you can adjust the type accordingly.
Also, I've used the default(shared) clause to specify that all variables are shared among threads, except for the private variables i and j which are declared private to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable that can be run in parallel using multiple threads.

    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val, x, and y arrays, as is common in numerical computations. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the default(shared) clause to specify that all variables are shared among threads, except for the private variables i and j which are each thread's own copy. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT directives in the OpenACC code.

You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.
