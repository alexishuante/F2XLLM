Output 1:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
CUDA:
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I've added a kernel launch configuration to split the work among multiple blocks and threads. You'll need to compile the CUDA code with the nvcc compiler and link against the CUDA runtime library.
Also, in the OpenACC version, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to mark the loop as a kernel for acceleration on the GPU. You'll need to compile the code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI suite.


Output 2:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
CUDA:

    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I assumed a block size of 256, but you can adjust this as needed for your specific use case. Also, in the OpenACC version, I used the #pragma acc kernels directive to mark the loop for parallelization, but you may need to add additional directives or configure your compiler to enable OpenACC support.


Output 3:

    }
}
CUDA:

}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I've assumed that the x and y arrays are already allocated on the device. If that's not the case, you'll need to add code to allocate and copy the data to the device. Also, the blockSize and numBlocks calculations are just examples, and you may need to adjust them depending on your specific use case.


Output 4:
Here are the implementations of the AXPY operation in C, CUDA, Fortran, and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
CUDA:
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
}
Fortran with OpenACC:
subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real, intent(in) :: a
    real, intent(in) :: x(n)
    real, intent(inout) :: y(n)
    integer :: i
    !$acc kernels
    do i = 1, n
        y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
    end do
    !$acc end kernels
end subroutine saxpy
Note that the CUDA implementation assumes that the x and y arrays have already been copied to the device. You will need to add additional code to handle the memory transfers between the host and device.
Also, the OpenACC implementation is similar to the original Fortran code, with the addition of the !$acc kernels directive to specify the parallel region. The compiler will generate the necessary GPU code and handle the memory transfers.


Output 5:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
CUDA:
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I've added a kernel launch configuration to determine the number of blocks and threads per block, based on the input size n. This is a common practice in CUDA programming to achieve parallelism. Also, in the OpenACC version, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to offload the computation to the accelerator device.


Output 6:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;

    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I assumed that the float* arguments point to device memory. If they point to host memory, you'll need to add memory transfers between host and device. Also, the saxpy_kernel function is launched with a block size of 256 threads, but you can adjust this value depending on your specific use case.


Output 7:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {

    }
}

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int blockSize = 256;
    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I assumed a block size of 256, but this can be adjusted based on the specific hardware and use case. Also, in the OpenACC version, I used the kernels directive to specify that the loop should be executed on the accelerator, and the loop independent directive to indicate that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently.


Output 8:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
CUDA:
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}
You can call the CUDA kernel like this:
int blockSize = 256;
int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
saxpy_kernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in the CUDA version, I assumed that the arrays x and y are already allocated on the device. If that's not the case, you'll need to add code to allocate and copy the data to the device. Similarly, in the OpenACC version, I assumed that the arrays are already present on the accelerator. If that's not the case, you'll need to add directives to allocate and copy the data.


Output 9:
Here are the equivalent functions in C and CUDA, and in C and OpenACC:
C:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
CUDA:
__global__ void saxpy_kernel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        y[idx] = a * x[idx] + y[idx];
    }
}
C with OpenACC:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in the CUDA version, you will need to launch the kernel with the appropriate number of blocks and threads to cover the entire array. Also, in the OpenACC version, the #pragma acc loop independent directive is used to indicate that the loop can be parallelized.
Also, the Fortran version you provided uses single precision real numbers, so I used float in the C and CUDA versions. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double.

}
Note that in the CUDA version, I assumed a block size of 256, but you can adjust this as needed for your specific use case. Also, in the OpenACC version, I used the kernels directive to mark the loop for parallelization, but you may need to add additional directives or clauses depending on your specific use case.
