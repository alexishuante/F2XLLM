Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the openacc directives are used to parallelize the loops.
To compile this code, you would need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc from the Portland Group, and link against the OpenACC library. For example:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran.
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran.
Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to parallelize the inner loop, which performs the dot product of the i-th row of A and the vector x. This clause tells OpenACC to create a private copy of the sum variable for each thread, and then reduce them into a single value at the end of the loop.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding
...
interface
  subroutine gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(C_INT) :: n
    real(C_FLOAT) :: A(n, n), x(n), y(n)
  end subroutine gemv_parallel
end interface
...
call gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y)
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to manually calculate the index A[i * n + j] to access the element at row i and column j. Also, the #pragma acc loop directive is used to indicate that the inner loop can be parallelized.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
gcc -fopenacc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device supported by OpenACC.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrix A. Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.
You can compile this function with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the Portland Group, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.
You can also use the #pragma acc data directive to specify the data that needs to be transferred to the device, and the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify the kernels that should be executed on the device. Here is an example:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc data copy(A[:n*n], x[:n], y[:n])
  #pragma acc kernels
  {
    #pragma acc loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      sum = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop
      for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
      }
      y[i] = sum;
    }
  }
}
This way you can specify the data that needs to be transferred to the device and the kernels that should be executed on the device.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and we use float instead of real as the type. Also, the array indices are adjusted to match C's row-major ordering.
To compile this code, you would use a command like:
gcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c -lOpenACC
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on a device that supports OpenACC (such as an NVIDIA GPU).


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly. Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to avoid race conditions in the parallel reduction.
As for the Fortran with OpenACC, your code looks correct, but I'll re-write it with the correct syntax for OpenACC 2.5 and later:
subroutine gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real, intent(in) :: A(n, n)
    real, intent(in) :: x(n)
    real, intent(out) :: y(n)
    integer :: i, j
    real :: sum

    !$acc parallel loop reduction(+:sum)
    do i = 1, n
        sum = 0.0
        do j = 1, n
            sum = sum + A(i, j) * x(j)
        end do
        y(i) = sum
    end do
    !$acc end parallel loop
end subroutine gemv_parallel
Note that the reduction(+:sum) clause is moved to the parallel loop directive to specify that the reduction variable sum is shared among all threads.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the #pragma acc directives are used to specify the parallel regions and loops.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code will perform the GEMV operation in parallel using OpenACC.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {

    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed float precision, if you need double precision, just replace float with double in the code.
You can compile this code with OpenACC support using a compiler like pgcc or gcc with the -acc flag. For example:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on your system.
