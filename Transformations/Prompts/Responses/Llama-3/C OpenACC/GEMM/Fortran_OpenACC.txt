--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM subroutine in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the routine should be compiled for sequential execution on the accelerator, and #pragma acc parallel loop to specify the parallel loops. I've also used the private clause to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp should be private to each thread.
Also, I've assumed that the arrays a, b, and c are already allocated and copied to the device memory. If that's not the case, you'll need to add additional OpenACC directives to manage the data transfers.
Please note that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust it to fit your specific use case.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in the C version, we need to specify the array sizes explicitly in the loops, and we use pointer arithmetic to access the array elements. Additionally, we use #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) to specify that the temp variable is a reduction variable in the inner loop.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed a, b, and c are column-major matrices, as is typical in Fortran. I've also replaced real(kind=8) with double, which is the standard way to declare double-precision floating-point numbers in C. Additionally, I've added the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the function contains sequential code that can be executed on the accelerator.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the function contains sequential code that can be executed on the accelerator. I've also used the #pragma acc parallel loop directive to specify the parallel loop, and the collapse(2) clause to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop. Additionally, I've used the private clause to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
Please note that this is a direct translation of the Fortran code, and you may need to adjust the memory layout and indexing to match your specific use case.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 1; l <= k; l++) {
        temp += a[(i - 1) + (l - 1) * lda] * b[(l - 1) + (j - 1) * ldb];
      }
      c[(i - 1) + (j - 1) * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[(i - 1) + (j - 1) * ldc];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed a, b, and c are passed as pointers to the beginning of the arrays, and that the array indices are 0-based (as in C). Also, I've used #pragma acc routine seq to indicate that the function contains sequential code that can be executed by the accelerator.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM subroutine in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the routine should be compiled for sequential execution on the accelerator, and #pragma acc parallel loop to specify the parallel loops. Additionally, I've used the collapse(2) clause to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop, and the private clause to specify the variables that should be privatized for each thread.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and that the array indices are 0-based in C (as opposed to 1-based in Fortran). Additionally, I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the function contains sequential code that can be executed on the accelerator.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, the array indexing in C is done using pointer arithmetic, which is different from Fortran's array indexing.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and that the arrays are stored in column-major order (as is typical in Fortran). I've also added the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the function should be compiled for the accelerator, and the private clause to specify which variables should be privatized across threads.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the function contains sequential code that can be executed by an accelerator. Additionally, I've used the #pragma acc parallel loop directive to specify the parallel loops, and the #pragma acc loop seq directive to specify the sequential loop. Finally, I've used the collapse(2) clause to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
