--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 1; l <= k; l++) {
        temp += a[(i - 1) * lda + l - 1] * b[(l - 1) * ldb + j - 1];
      }
      c[(i - 1) * ldc + j - 1] = alpha * temp + beta * c[(i - 1) * ldc + j - 1];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the input matrices are column-major, which is the default in Fortran. If your matrices are row-major, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly. Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels loop independent to parallelize the outer loops, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) to perform a reduction on the temp variable.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, similar to OpenMP, but it's designed for accelerators like GPUs. You may need to adjust the pragmas and the code to suit your specific use case.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    #pragma acc loop gang vector
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and that the arrays are stored in column-major order (which is the default in Fortran). Also, I've used the gang and vector directives to parallelize the loops, and the seq directive to ensure that the innermost loop is executed sequentially.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector(128) collapse(2) independent
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used #pragma acc routine seq to indicate that the function should be compiled for the accelerator, and #pragma acc parallel loop to specify the parallelization strategy. I've also used gang vector(128) to specify the block size for the parallelization, and collapse(2) to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop. Additionally, I've used #pragma acc loop seq to specify that the innermost loop should be executed sequentially.
Please note that this is just one possible way to implement the GEMM operation in C with OpenACC, and there may be other ways to optimize the code depending on the specific hardware and software environment.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, the array indexing is changed to the C-style row-major ordering. Additionally, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the function contains sequential code, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the loops. The gang vector clause is used to specify the parallelization strategy, and the private clause is used to specify the private variables for each gang.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM operation in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that this implementation assumes that the input matrices are stored in column-major order, which is the default for Fortran. If your C program uses row-major order, you will need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the function contains sequential code that can be executed on the accelerator. The #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop seq directive is used to indicate that the inner loop should be executed sequentially.
You may need to adjust the OpenACC directives and the loop ordering to optimize the performance for your specific use case.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 1; l <= k; l++) {
        temp += a[(i - 1) + (l - 1) * lda] * b[(l - 1) + (j - 1) * ldb];
      }
      c[(i - 1) + (j - 1) * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[(i - 1) + (j - 1) * ldc];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used the kernels directive to parallelize the outer loops, and the loop directive with the reduction clause to parallelize the inner loop and perform the reduction operation. I've also assumed that the input matrices are stored in column-major order, as is typical in Fortran. If your matrices are stored in row-major order, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used the double type to match the real(kind=8) type in Fortran, but you may need to adjust this depending on your specific compiler and settings.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 1; l <= k; l++) {
        temp += a[(i - 1) + (l - 1) * lda] * b[(l - 1) + (j - 1) * ldb];
      }
      c[(i - 1) + (j - 1) * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[(i - 1) + (j - 1) * ldc];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the arrays a, b, and c are already allocated and available on the device. If that's not the case, you may need to add additional OpenACC directives to manage data transfers.
Also, keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, so the compiler will generate the parallel code based on the directives provided. In this case, the #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to generate parallel code for the nested loops.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM operation in C using OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the a, b, and c matrices are stored in column-major order, which is the default for Fortran. If your matrices are stored in row-major order, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to indicate that the loop should be executed on the accelerator, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive to specify that the temp variable should be reduced across threads using the + operator.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust it to suit your specific needs.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, similar to OpenMP. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to generate parallel code for the following loop. The loop independent clause indicates that the iterations of the loop are independent and can be executed concurrently.
Also, note that in C, we need to explicitly calculate the memory addresses for the 2D arrays a and b, whereas in Fortran, the compiler takes care of this for us.
Please let me know if you have any further questions!

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed a, b, and c are pointers to memory allocated on the host, and that you want to parallelize the loops using OpenACC's gang-vector model. Also, I've replaced real(kind=8) with double, as it's the equivalent type in C.
You may need to adjust the memory allocation and data transfer between host and device to suit your specific use case. Additionally, you can optimize the OpenACC directives to better suit your hardware architecture.
