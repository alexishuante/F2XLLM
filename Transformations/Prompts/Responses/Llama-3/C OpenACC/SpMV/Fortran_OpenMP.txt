--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the val array is of type float, if it's actually double, you should replace float with double in the function signature and the reduction clause.
Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive is used to perform a reduction operation on the y[i] variable, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in the Fortran code.
You can compile this code with a C compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the SpMV operation in C using OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels present(val, row, col, x, y)
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this implementation assumes that the input arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already allocated and initialized on the device (GPU). The #pragma acc kernels present directive tells the compiler to generate code that will execute on the device, and the #pragma acc loop directives specify which loops should be parallelized.
Also, the reduction clause is used to parallelize the inner loop, which performs a reduction operation (sum) on the sum variable.
You can adjust the OpenACC directives to fit your specific use case and compiler.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the SpMV operation in C using OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the val array is of type float, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify that the outer loop should be parallelized, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive to specify that the inner loop should be reduced using the + operator.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you'll need to ensure that the necessary OpenACC libraries and headers are included in your project.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are float arrays, and y is a float array. If they are double, you can replace float with double. Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels loop independent to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) to perform a reduction operation on y[i].
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the compiler will generate the corresponding parallel code based on the directives. The actual parallelization may vary depending on the compiler and the target architecture.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the copyin and copy clauses in the #pragma acc directive are used to specify the data that needs to be copied to the accelerator device (GPU or other) and back to the host, respectively.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, similar to OpenMP, and it's used to offload computations to accelerator devices. The #pragma acc directives are used to specify the regions of code that should be executed on the accelerator device.
Also, the reduction(+:y[i]) clause is used to specify that the y[i] variable should be reduced (summed) across all threads in the team. This is equivalent to the DEFAULT(NONE) SHARED clause in OpenMP, which ensures that the y array is shared among all threads and updated correctly.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the val array is of type float, if it's double you should change the type accordingly. Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive is used to perform a reduction operation on the y[i] variable, which is equivalent to the OpenMP reduction(+:y) clause.
Please note that the OpenACC implementation may vary depending on the compiler and the device you are targeting.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are float arrays, and y is a float array. If they are double, you can replace float with double. Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels loop independent to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) to perform a reduction operation on y[i].
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the compiler will generate the parallel code based on the directives. The code above is a C function with OpenACC directives.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are float arrays, if they are double you should change the type accordingly. Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive is used to perform a reduction operation on the y array, which is equivalent to the parallel reduction performed by OpenMP.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is designed for offloading computations to accelerators, so you may need to add additional directives to specify the device and data management.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator/Accelerator.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin and copy clauses in the #pragma acc directive are used to specify the data that needs to be copied to the accelerator device.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, and the compiler will generate the necessary code to execute the parallel loop on the accelerator device. The reduction clause is used to specify that the y array is being reduced (summed) across the parallel loop iterations.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a supported accelerator device, such as an NVIDIA GPU.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels present(val, row, col, x, y)
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I assumed val and x are float arrays, if they are double you need to change the type accordingly. Also, I used #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) to specify that the inner loop reduces the value of y[i].
You can compile this code with a OpenACC supporting compiler like pgcc or gcc with OpenACC support.
