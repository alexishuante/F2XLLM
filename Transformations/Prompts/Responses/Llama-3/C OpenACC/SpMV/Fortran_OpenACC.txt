--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is a double array too. Also, I've replaced the integer type with int, as C uses int for integer types.
Also, the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses in OpenACC are replaced with present and copyout in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive, respectively.
Please note that the Fortran code uses 1-based indexing, while C uses 0-based indexing, so I've adjusted the loop indices accordingly.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are float arrays, and y is a float array too. If they are double, you can replace float with double. Also, I've used #pragma acc parallel loop and #pragma acc loop to specify the parallel regions, which is the OpenACC syntax for C/C++.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and row and col are int arrays, based on the Fortran code. Also, I've replaced the DO loops with for loops, and adjusted the indexing to match C's 0-based indexing. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran is equivalent to float in C, and I've used the #pragma acc directives to specify the parallel regions and data movement. Also, I've adjusted the loop indices to match C's 0-based indexing.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C. If you need to use double precision, you can replace float with double. Also, I've included the necessary header files for OpenACC. The #pragma acc directives are used to specify the parallel regions and data movement.
Please note that this is a direct translation, and you may need to adjust the memory management and data types according to your specific use case.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to float in C. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double. Also, I've used the Accelerate.h header which is specific to Apple's implementation of OpenACC. If you're using a different compiler, you may need to include a different header file.
Also, please note that the array indices in C start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop limits accordingly.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made the following changes:
Changed the function name to spmv_parallel to match the Fortran subroutine name.
Changed the integer types to int to match C's standard integer type.
Changed the real types to float to match C's standard floating-point type.
Replaced the DO loops with C-style for loops.
Replaced the !$ACC directives with #pragma acc to match C's preprocessor syntax.
Changed the array indexing to match C's 0-based indexing.
Removed the PRESENT clause, as it's not necessary in C.
Added #include statements for the necessary headers.
Please note that this code assumes that the input arrays are already allocated and initialized. If you need help with allocation and initialization, let me know!

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, the loop bounds have been adjusted to match C's 0-based indexing. Additionally, the PRESENT clause in Fortran is not necessary in C, as the compiler will automatically determine which variables are present on the device.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are float arrays, and y is a float array too. If they are double, you should replace float with double in the function signature and the #pragma acc directives.
Also, I've used the present clause to indicate that the arrays val, row, col, and x are already present on the accelerator device, and the copyout clause to indicate that the array y should be copied from the host to the device at the beginning of the parallel region, and copied back to the host at the end of the parallel region.
Finally, I've used the reduction clause to indicate that the inner loop performs a reduction operation on the y array, which allows the compiler to generate more efficient code for the parallel reduction.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are arrays of double since the Fortran code uses real. If they should be a different type, you can adjust accordingly. Also, I've kept the same loop structure and OpenACC directives as the original Fortran code. Let me know if you have any questions!
