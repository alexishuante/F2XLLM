--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels loop independent to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) to perform a reduction on the sum variable. This is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in the Fortran code.
You'll need to compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices and vectors are stored in column-major order, which is the default for Fortran. If your matrices and vectors are stored in row-major order (C-style), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used float instead of real since C doesn't have a built-in real type. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if you need double precision.
You'll need to compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as PGI or GCC, and link with an accelerator library, such as NVIDIA's cuBLAS, to run this code on a GPU.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. Also, I've replaced the real type with float, since OpenACC is typically used with single precision floating point numbers. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify that the outer loop should be executed on the accelerator, and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive to specify that the inner loop should be reduced using the + operator.
You'll need to compile this code with a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as the PGI compiler or the NVIDIA HPC SDK compiler.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop independent directive tells OpenACC that each iteration of the loop can be executed independently, and the reduction(+:sum) directive tells OpenACC to perform a reduction on the sum variable.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to swap the indices in the A array.
Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type that suits your needs.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, similar to OpenMP, but it's designed for accelerators like GPUs. The kernels directive tells the compiler to generate a kernel for the accelerator, and the loop directive specifies which loops to parallelize. The reduction clause is used to perform a reduction operation (in this case, a sum) in parallel.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <accelerator.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that the OpenACC implementation is slightly different from the OpenMP version. In OpenACC, we use #pragma acc kernels to specify the parallel region, and loop independent to indicate that the loop iterations are independent and can be executed in parallel. The reduction(+:sum) clause is used to perform a reduction operation on the sum variable, which is equivalent to the private variable in OpenMP.
Also, note that in C, we need to use pointers to arrays and explicitly calculate the indices, whereas in Fortran, we can use 2D arrays directly.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerate.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays, with the matrix stored in row-major order (i.e., A[i * n + j] corresponds to the element at row i and column j). I've also used the Accelerate.h header, which provides the OpenACC directives.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible way to implement the GEMV operation in C with OpenACC. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to modify the code to suit your needs.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels loop independent to indicate that the outer loop can be parallelized, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) to indicate that the inner loop reduces the sum variable. This allows the compiler to generate the appropriate parallel code for the accelerator.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays, with the matrix stored in row-major order. I've also used float instead of real to match the C standard.
Also, keep in mind that OpenACC and OpenMP have different programming models, so the translation is not always straightforward. The kernels directive in OpenACC tells the compiler to generate an accelerator kernel, and the loop directive specifies which loops to parallelize. The reduction clause is used to perform a reduction operation (in this case, a sum) in parallel.
Please note that this code might need to be adjusted to fit your specific use case.
