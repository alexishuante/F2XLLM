--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with CUDA:
__global__ void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];

    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
}
You can call the saxpy_host function from your CPU code, passing in the necessary pointers and the value of n. The saxpy kernel function will be executed on the GPU, performing the AXPY operation in parallel.
Note that this implementation assumes that x and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You will need to add additional code to handle memory allocation and data transfer between the host and device.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with CUDA:
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
}
Note that this implementation assumes that the input arrays x and y are already allocated and copied to the device. You will need to add additional code to handle device memory allocation and data transfer.
Also, the saxpy_host function is a wrapper that launches the CUDA kernel and synchronizes the device. You can call this function from your host code to perform the AXPY operation.
You can also use the following code to launch the kernel:
cudaLaunchKernel((void*)saxpy, dim3(numBlocks), dim3(blockSize), 0, 0, n, a, x, y);

    saxpy<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
}
Note that this implementation assumes that the input arrays x and y are already allocated and copied to the device. You will need to add additional code to allocate and copy the data to the device, and to free the device memory when finished.
Also, the Fortran code uses real which is typically equivalent to float in C, if you want to use double precision, you need to change the type to double and also the a parameter in the Fortran code.
You can call the saxpy_cuda function from your C program, passing in the necessary parameters.

    int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
    saxpy<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(n, a, x, y);
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
}
Note that this implementation assumes that the input arrays x and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You will need to add additional code to allocate and copy the data to the GPU, and to check for CUDA errors.
Also, note that the saxpy_wrapper function is used to launch the CUDA kernel and to synchronize the device after the kernel launch.
You can use the following code to allocate and copy the data to the GPU:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x_host, float *y_host) {
    float *x_device;
    float *y_device;
    cudaMalloc((void **)&x_device, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&y_device, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMemcpy(x_device, x_host, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(y_device, y_host, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
