--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP to compute the AXPY operation:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran which starts from 1.
Let me know if you need any further assistance!

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP that computes the AXPY operation:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the required arguments. Make sure to link with the OpenMP library (-fopenmp flag) while compiling.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the type for a, x, and y, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can call this function from your C program, passing the required arguments. Make sure to link with OpenMP libraries while compiling.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP that computes the AXPY operation:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed real in Fortran is equivalent to float in C. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double. Also, note that array indices in C start at 0, so I changed the loop to start at 0 instead of 1.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the type for a, x, and y, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
