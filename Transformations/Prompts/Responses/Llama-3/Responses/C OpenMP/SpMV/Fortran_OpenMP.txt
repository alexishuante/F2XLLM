--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is a double array too. If your data type is different, you can change the type accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran. The default(none) clause specifies that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause specifies the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause specifies the variables that are private to each thread.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val is an array of double since the Fortran code uses real, which typically corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in the Fortran code.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, the loop indices in C start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop limits accordingly. Additionally, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel and #pragma omp for separately, as it is a more concise and efficient way to parallelize the loop.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made the following changes:
Changed the subroutine to a function (as C doesn't have subroutines)
Changed the intent(in/out) to C-style function parameters
Changed the array declarations to C-style pointers
Changed the do loop to a for loop (as C doesn't have do loops)
Changed the !$OMP PARALLEL DO to #pragma omp parallel for (as C uses pragmas for OpenMP directives)
Please note that this code assumes that the input arrays are already allocated and initialized, and that the output array y is already allocated.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is also a double array. If your data type is different, you can adjust accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel and #pragma omp for as in the Fortran version, since the C version uses a for loop instead of a do loop. This directive will parallelize the outer loop, and each iteration will be executed by a different thread.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val is an array of double since the Fortran code uses real, which typically corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in the Fortran code.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function implemented with OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are of type double since the Fortran code uses real. If you need to use a different type, you can adjust the code accordingly.
Also, keep in mind that the loop bounds and array indices have been adjusted to match C's 0-based indexing, unlike Fortran's 1-based indexing.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is a double array, since the Fortran code uses real which typically corresponds to double in C. Also, I've adjusted the loop indices to match C's 0-based indexing.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are arrays of double since the Fortran code uses real. If your data type is different, you can adjust accordingly. Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, just like the Fortran code.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is a double array too. Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, and the default(none) clause to specify that the variables are shared by default, except for i and j which are private.
