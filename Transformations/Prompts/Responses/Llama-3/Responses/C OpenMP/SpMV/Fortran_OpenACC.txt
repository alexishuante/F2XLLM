--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are of type double, and y is also of type double. If your data types are different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, and the compiler will take care of creating threads and distributing the work among them.
Keep in mind that OpenMP and OpenACC have different syntax and semantics, so the translation is not always one-to-one. However, this C function should be equivalent to your original Fortran subroutine.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val is an array of double since the Fortran code uses real. If val is actually an array of float, you can change the type in the C function accordingly. Also, the default(none) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each variable is treated as a separate entity, and the shared clause specifies which variables are shared among threads.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is also a double array. If your data type is different, you can change the type accordingly.
Also, note that the default(none) clause is used to specify that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among threads. This is a good practice to avoid accidental sharing of variables.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler like GCC or Clang, and link with a library like OpenBLAS or MKL for optimal performance.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I assumed val and x are of type double since the Fortran code uses real. If they are of a different type, you may need to adjust the C code accordingly. Also, the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses in OpenACC are not necessary in OpenMP, as the parallel region will automatically capture the necessary data.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made the following assumptions:
The real type in Fortran is equivalent to double in C.
The integer type in Fortran is equivalent to int in C.
The val, row, col, x, and y arrays are assumed to be passed by reference (i.e., pointers) in the C function.
The n and nnz parameters are assumed to be passed by value.
The default(none) clause in the OpenMP directive specifies that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause specifies the variables that are shared among threads.
Also, note that the loop iteration variable i is declared inside the loop in the C code, which is a common practice in C programming. This is different from the Fortran code, where the iteration variable is declared before the loop.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val, x, and y are double arrays, and row and col are int arrays. Also, the loop bounds have been adjusted to match C's 0-based indexing.
The OpenMP directive #pragma omp parallel for is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the default(none) clause specifies that no variables are shared by default. The shared clause is used to specify the arrays that are shared among threads.
You can adjust the type declarations and loop bounds as needed to match your specific requirements.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made the following changes:
I've replaced the real type with double to match the C standard.
I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP in OpenACC.
I've used default(none) to specify that no variables are shared by default, and then explicitly listed the shared variables using shared(val, row, col, x, y).
I've changed the loop indices to start from 0, as C arrays are 0-indexed.
This C code with OpenMP should perform the same sparse matrix-vector multiplication as the original Fortran code with OpenACC.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is also a double array. If they are actually float arrays, you can replace double with float in the C code.
Also, the default(none) clause in the OpenMP directive specifies that the programmer is responsible for explicitly listing the shared and private variables, which is good practice for clarity and to avoid potential errors.
Finally, the shared clause specifies that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads, and the n variable is also shared. If any of these variables were private to each thread, you would need to use the private clause instead.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val is an array of double since the Fortran code uses real. If val is actually an array of float, you can change the type accordingly. Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in OpenACC.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed val and x are double arrays, and y is also a double array. If they are float arrays, you can replace double with float. Also, I've used default(none) to specify that each thread should have its own copy of the variables, and shared to specify the arrays that are shared among threads.
Also, note that OpenMP uses #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, whereas OpenACC uses !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP to parallelize the loop.
