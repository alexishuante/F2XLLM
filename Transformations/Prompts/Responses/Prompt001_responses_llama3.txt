Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so x and y are declared as float *. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, not 1, as in C arrays are 0-indexed.
You can call this function in a similar way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the array sizes and pointers to the arrays. Don't forget to include the OpenMP header (#include <omp.h>) and compile with OpenMP support.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've used float as the type for a, x, and y, but you can change it to double if you need double precision. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
Also, make sure to include the OpenMP header (#include <omp.h>) and compile with OpenMP enabled (-fopenmp flag for GCC) to use this function.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, whereas it starts from 1 in Fortran. This is because C uses zero-based indexing, whereas Fortran uses one-based indexing.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the appropriate arguments. For example:
int main() {
    int n = 100;
    float a = 2.0;
    float x[n], y[n];

    // Initialize x and y arrays

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    return 0;
}
This will compute the AXPY operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've used float as the data type, assuming that's what you intended. If you need double precision, simply replace float with double.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loop, which is equivalent to the Fortran !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive. This will automatically distribute the loop iterations across the available threads.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop index i starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the appropriate arguments. Don't forget to include the OpenMP header (#include <omp.h>) and link the OpenMP library when compiling your program.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, whereas it starts from 1 in Fortran.
You can call this function from your main program, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 100;
    float a = 2.0;
    float x[n], y[n];

    // Initialize x and y arrays

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP enabled, for example:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
This will create an executable file saxpy_parallel that you can run.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've used float as the type for a, x, and y, but you can change it to double if you need double precision. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop, similar to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to the first elements of the arrays. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, not 1, as in Fortran.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
And run it with:
./saxpy_parallel
Make sure to link with the OpenMP library (-fopenmp flag).


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the AXPY operation:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran which starts from 1.
You can compile and run this code using an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
This will generate an executable file saxpy_parallel that you can run using:
./saxpy_parallel
Make sure to link the OpenMP library (-fopenmp flag) and include the necessary header file (#include <omp.h>) to use OpenMP in your C code.
