Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      sum += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to OpenACC, to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel function spmv_kernel performs the same operations as the original Fortran code, but uses CUDA-like syntax and indexing.
Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may need to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.


Output 2:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL((spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]-1; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to OpenACC, but provides more low-level control over the parallelization. The spmv_kernel function is executed in parallel on the GPU, and the hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel. The dim3 variables specify the block and grid dimensions, and the 0, 0 arguments specify the shared memory and stream ID, respectively.
Also, note that I've assumed that the val, row, col, x, and y arrays are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You may need to add additional code to handle the data transfer and allocation.

Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is written in CUDA C++ and performs the same computation as the original Fortran OpenACC code. The hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel, and the HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel.
Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may need to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.

  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0,
    n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP kernel launch syntax, which is similar to CUDA's kernel launch syntax. The HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function, and the dim3 variables are used to specify the grid and block dimensions.
Also, the hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel, which is similar to the cudaLaunchKernel function in CUDA.
You will need to compile this code with a HIP-compatible compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and link it with the HIP runtime library.
You can also use the hipify tool to convert the OpenACC code to HIP code, it will generate the equivalent HIP code for the OpenACC code.

Output 5:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP kernel launch syntax and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function. The kernel function is launched using the hipLaunchKernelGGL function, which is similar to the ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in OpenACC. The kernel function performs the same sparse matrix-vector multiplication as the original Fortran code.
Also, note that the code assumes that the HIP runtime is properly initialized and that the necessary memory allocations and data transfers have been performed.


Output 6:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {

    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to OpenACC, but for AMD GPUs. The hipLaunchKernelGGL function launches the spmv_kernel kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU.
Also, the code assumes that the input arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You may need to add additional code to handle the data transfer between the host and device.
You can use the HIP runtime API to compile and run this code on a system with an AMD GPU. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:

  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel function spmv_kernel performs the same operation as the original Fortran code, but is written in C/C++ and uses HIP syntax.
Also, the HIP_KERNEL_NAME macro is used to specify the name of the kernel function. This is a HIP-specific feature that allows the kernel function to be easily identified and optimized by the HIP compiler.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that HIP (HIP Infrastructure for Parallel Acceleration) is a C++ runtime API for parallel computing on AMD GPUs, and it is similar to OpenACC. The hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword is used to define the kernel function that is executed on the GPU. The kernel function is executed in parallel for each block and each thread.
Also, note that I have assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C/C++. If you need to use double precision, you can replace float with double in the code.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note: HIP (HIP Infrastructure Platform) is an open-source software development platform for GPU computing, similar to OpenACC. The code uses HIP's kernel launch syntax to parallelize the SpMV operation on the GPU.
Also, the hipLaunchKernelGGL function is used to launch the kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword is used to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is executed in parallel by multiple threads, each processing a different row of the sparse matrix.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(HIP_KERNEL_NAME(spmv_kernel), dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
}

__global__ void spmv_kernel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows you to run the kernel on the GPU. The spmv_parallel function launches the spmv_kernel kernel on the GPU, and the kernel performs the SpMV operation in parallel.
Also, note that I've assumed that the val, row, col, x, and y arrays are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You'll need to use HIP APIs to allocate and copy the data to the GPU before calling the spmv_parallel function.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
