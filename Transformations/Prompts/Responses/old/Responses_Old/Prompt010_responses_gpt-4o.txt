Output 1:
Below is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code for Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation, using OpenMP for parallelization. The OpenMP paradigm is leveraged to provide parallel execution.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Parallel For Directive (`#pragma omp parallel for`):**
   - This directive tells the OpenMP runtime to parallelize the following `for` loop. Each iteration of the loop will be executed in parallel by multiple threads.
   
2. **Loop Indexing:**
   - The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1` instead of `1` to `n` as in the original Fortran code, to adhere to C/C++'s zero-based array indexing.
   
3. **Array Access Adjustments:**
   - The innermost loop accesses the `val` and `col` arrays directly, similar to the provided Fortran code, with adjusted indexing to match C/C++ conventions.
   
4. **Initialization of `y[i]`:**
   - Each element of `y` is explicitly initialized to `0.0f` before the inner loop starts accumulating contributions from the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix.

5. **Data Types:**
   - The data types are chosen to closely align with those in the Fortran code, using `float` for real numbers and `int` for integers.

To compile and run the C/C++ program with OpenMP, ensure you pass the appropriate flag (`-fopenmp` for GCC/Clang or `/openmp` for MSVC) to the compiler:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp spmv.c -o spmv
./spmv
```

This code should achieve similar parallel performance benefits as the original Fortran OpenACC version by dividing the outer loop iterations among multiple threads.

Output 2:
Certainly! Here's the C/C++ code equivalent of your Fortran OpenACC code using OpenMP for parallelism:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication using OpenMP
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Headers**: The `#include <omp.h>` directive includes the OpenMP library, which is needed for parallel processing in C/C++.

2. **Function Signature**:
   ```c
   void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y)
   ```
   This function takes integers `n` and `nnz`, pointers to arrays `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y`. These arrays contain the matrix and vector data necessary to perform the SpMV operation.

3. **OpenMP Parallel For**:
   ```c
   #pragma omp parallel for
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       y[i] = 0.0;
       for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
           y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
       }
   }
   ```
   This code uses the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop. This means each iteration of the loop (for different values of `i`) will be executed in parallel by different threads.

4. **Array Indexing**:
   - Unlike Fortran, C/C++ arrays are typically zero-indexed. Therefore, the loops start from 0 and go up to one less than the size (`i = 0; i < n; i++`).

5. **Change in Data Types**:
   - The Fortran `real` type is often equivalent to the `double` type in C/C++, so we use `double` for `val`, `x`, and `y`.

6. **Loop Bounds**:
   - Ensure the loop bounds in C/C++ are correctly set with zero-indexed semantics (`i < n` and `j < row[i+1]`).

By using OpenMP's parallel for directive, we enable the outer loop to run in parallel, potentially utilizing multiple CPU cores to speed up the computation. Make sure to compile the code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as `gcc` with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
```

These modifications provide a direct translation of the Fortran OpenACC code into C/C++ with OpenMP for parallel Sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

Output 3:
Sure, here's an equivalent implementation of the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenMP in C/C++:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <vector>

// Function declaration
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const std::vector<float>& val, const std::vector<int>& row, const std::vector<int>& col, const std::vector<float>& x, std::vector<float>& y);

// Function definition
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const std::vector<float>& val, const std::vector<int>& row, const std::vector<int>& col, const std::vector<float>& x, std::vector<float>& y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

// Sample main function to demonstrate usage
int main() {
    int n = 5;  // number of rows/columns in the matrix
    int nnz = 9; // number of non-zero elements

    std::vector<float> val = {10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0};
    std::vector<int> row = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}; // row pointers
    std::vector<int> col = {0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}; // column indices
    std::vector<float> x = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}; // input vector
    std::vector<float> y(n, 0.0); // output vector initialized to 0

    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Headers**: We include the necessary header file `omp.h` for OpenMP.
2. **Vectors for Input/Output**: We use C++ `std::vector` to handle input and output arrays similar to Fortran arrays passed into the function.
3. **Parallelization using OpenMP**:
    - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over rows (`i`).
    - Note that `private` clause for `j` is implicit as `j` is declared inside the loop.
4. **Main Function**: A sample `main` function is included to demonstrate how to call the `spmv_parallel` function, with example data.

Make sure you compile the code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler flag, such as `-fopenmp` for GCC:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o spmv_example spmv_example.cpp
./spmv_example
```

This will compile and execute the program, demonstrating the sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

Output 4:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C/C++ code that uses OpenMP to achieve a parallel Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation. The OpenMP syntax allows for parallelization in a way similar to OpenACC in Fortran.

Here’s the C/C++ code with OpenMP directives:

```c++
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y)
{
    // Parallelize the outer loop
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j)
        {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive tells the OpenMP runtime to parallelize the for loop that follows it.
- In C++, array indices start from 0 by default, so `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)` is used, unlike Fortran where array indexing starts from 1.
- The nested loop iterates over the non-zero elements of each row and performs the multiplication and summation to compute the resultant vector `y`.

### Usage:
1. Make sure to include OpenMP headers by adding `#include <omp.h>`.
2. Compile the code with OpenMP support, typically using `-fopenmp` flag with `gcc`/`g++` compilers.

#### Example compilation command (with `g++`):
```bash
g++ -fopenmp -o spmv spmv.cpp
```

### Note:
Ensure that the array dimensions and the input data follow the CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format, which is commonly used in the context of sparse matrices.

Output 5:
Sure! Below is the C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenMP:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV)
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Headers:** We include the `omp.h` header to use OpenMP directives.
   
2. **Function Prototype:** 
   - The function `spmv_parallel` takes the sizes `n` and `nnz` as input.
   - It also takes pointers to the `val`, `row`, `col`, and `x` arrays as inputs. The `y` array is taken as output.

3. **OpenMP Directive:**
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive tells the OpenMP runtime to parallelize the following `for` loop (the outer `for` loop over `i`).

4. **Loop Structure:** 
   - The outer loop iterates over rows of the sparse matrix.
   - The inner loop iterates over non-zero elements in the current row, accumulating the product `val[j] * x[col[j]]` into `y[i]`.

Make sure to compile your C/C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, using `g++`:
```sh
g++ -fopenmp spmv_parallel.cpp -o spmv_parallel
```

This should give you a parallelized version of the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication using OpenMP in C/C++.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is a translation of the provided Fortran OpenACC code for Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation into a C/C++ version using OpenMP for parallelism:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Parallel region for the outer loop
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this translation:

1. **Data Types & Constants**:
    - The Fortran array indices are 1-based, whereas C/C++ uses 0-based indices. Thus, the loop range for `i` in C/C++ goes from `0` to `n-1`.
    - The loops inside the function for `j` have been adjusted accordingly (`row[i]` to `row[i+1] - 1`). This logic remains unchanged except for using 0-based indexing.

2. **OpenMP Directives**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop. This makes each iteration of the loop run in parallel.
    - The default OpenMP shared memory model is assumed, i.e., arrays like `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y` are shared across threads.

Make sure to compile your C/C++ code with OpenMP support. For example, if you're using `gcc`, you can use the following command to compile the code:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv_parallel.c
```

Output 7:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent code for a Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenMP in C++:

```c++
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example initialization
    int n = 4; // Number of rows
    int nnz = 9; // Number of non-zero elements

    float val[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90};
    int row[] = {0, 1, 3, 6, 9};
    int col[] = {0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 3};
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    float y[n];

    // Run parallel SpMV
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Output the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parallel Directive with OpenMP:**
   The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used for parallelizing the outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`). OpenMP will distribute the iterations of this loop among available threads.

2. **Initialization and Arrays:**
   - `val` represents the non-zero values of the sparse matrix.
   - `row` array is used to index the beginning of each row in `val` and `col`.
   - `col` array represents the column indices corresponding to the values in `val`.
   - `x` is the input vector.
   - `y` is the output vector to store the resulting product.

3. **Loop Nest:**
   The nested loop structure iterates over each row `i` and for each row `i`, iterates over the non-zero column elements `j` to perform the multiplication and accumulation into `y[i]`.

This C++ OpenMP code provides a parallelization similar to what the provided Fortran OpenACC code achieves. The code assumes the use of standard initialization for arrays and vectors, and provides a straightforward approach to print the resulting output for validation.

Output 8:
To convert the provided Fortran OpenACC code for sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) into a C/C++ version using OpenMP for parallelization, follow these steps. I will provide a code example that mirrors the operations and structure of the Fortran code using C/C++ with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) schedule(static)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Here's the breakdown of the code:

- `spmv_parallel`: This is the function that performs sparse matrix-vector multiplication.
- Parameters:
  - `n`: Number of rows in the sparse matrix.
  - `nnz`: Number of non-zero elements in the sparse matrix.
  - `val`: Array containing the non-zero elements of the matrix.
  - `row`: Array of size `n + 1` where `row[i]` is the index in `val` and `col` of the first non-zero element in row `i`.
  - `col`: Array containing the column indices of the elements in `val`.
  - `x`: Input vector.
  - `y`: Output vector.

- The parallelization is achieved using OpenMP directives:
  - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive tells the compiler to parallelize the for loop that follows.
  - `private(i, j)`: Ensures that each thread has its private copy of the loop variables `i` and `j`.
  - `schedule(static)`: Distributes iterations of the for loop statically (each thread receives chunks of the iteration space at compile time).

This code performs the same operations as the Fortran OpenACC code, parallelizing the outer loop which iterates over each row of the sparse matrix, and summing up the product of the matrix entries and the corresponding entries in the input vector within nested loops.

Output 9:
Here is a version of the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) in C/C++ using OpenMP:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y, n) 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the following `for` loop. Each iteration of the loop will run concurrently in separate threads.
2. `default(none)`: This directive indicates that no variable is assumed to have any data-sharing attribute implicitly.
3. `shared(val, row, col, x, y, n)`: These variables are marked as shared across multiple threads. Each thread can read from and write to these variables.
4. `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`: This loop executes the sparse matrix-vector multiplication.
5. `y[i] = 0.0;`: Initializing the result vector element to zero before the inner loop.
6. `for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j)`: This inner loop handles the actual multiplication and accumulation for each non-zero entry in the sparse matrix.

By using OpenMP directives, the `spmv_parallel` function will distribute the work of the outer loop across multiple threads, thus providing a parallel implementation of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

Output 10:
Certainly! Below is a version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code rewritten in C/C++ with OpenMP to perform Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV). 

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

// Function declaration
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y);

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Parallel section using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f; // Initialize the result vector
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            // Perform SpMV computation
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    const int n = 5;
    const int nnz = 13;
    const float val[13] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130};
    const int row[6] = {0, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13}; // row array has n+1 elements
    const int col[13] = {0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4};
    const float x[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    float y[5];

    // Perform SpMV
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Key points to note in this code:
1. **Parallelization**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop over rows, which is typically the main entry point for parallelization in SpMV operations.
2. **Initialization**: The result vector `y[i]` is initialized to `0.0f` within the loop to prepare it for the accumulation.
3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop performs the summation for non-zero elements by going through the indices specified in the `row` array.

Make sure you compile the program with OpenMP support by using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC or the equivalent flag with other compilers, e.g.:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv_parallel.c
./spmv
```

This should give you the desired sparse matrix-vector multiplication functionality with parallel execution using OpenMP.
