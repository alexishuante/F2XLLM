Output 1:
Here's a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code implementing a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```cpp
#include <stddef.h>

void gemm_parallel(size_t m, size_t n, size_t k, double alpha, const double* a, size_t lda, const double* b, size_t ldb, double beta, double* c, size_t ldc) {
    size_t i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage here
    return 0;
}
```

Some key translations and considerations:
- Fortran arrays are 1-indexed and column-major order, while C/C++ arrays are 0-indexed and row-major order. The offset computation in C/C++ `a[i * lda + l]` corresponds to Fortran's `a(i, l)`.
- `#pragma acc` directives are used for parallelization.
- Since C/C++ pointers are used, care needs to be taken with the correct indexing.

This translation assumes that the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided in column-major order, as is standard in Fortran. If your C/C++ matrices are in row-major order, additional adjustments to indexing will be necessary.

Output 2:
Below is a C/C++ version of the Fortran OpenACC code implementing the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenACC

                       {7.0, 8.0, 9.0} };

    double b[k][n] = { {9.0, 8.0, 7.0}, 
                       {6.0, 5.0, 4.0},

    // Calling the gemm_parallel function
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double *)a, k, (double *)b, n, beta, (double *)c, n);

    // Output resulting matrix 'c'

        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `gemm_parallel` function performs the GEMM operation similar to the Fortran code given.
2. The input parameters:
    - `m, n, k` are the dimensions of the matrices.
    - `alpha` and `beta` are scalar constants.
    - `a, b, c` are the matrices in 1D array format with leading dimensions `lda, ldb, ldc` respectively.
3. The `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` directive parallelizes the matrix multiplication, collapsing the first two loops for better load balancing and efficiency.
4. The example usage in `main()` initializes specific matrices and displays the result after calling `gemm_parallel`.

Make sure you have appropriate OpenACC support in your compiler to successfully compile and run this program (e.g., PGI compiler).

Output 3:
Certainly! Here is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran subroutine using OpenACC to perform a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM):

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform the GEMM operation using OpenACC
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0;
    double beta = 1.0;
    double a[3][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} };
    double b[3][3] = { {9, 8, 7}, {6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1} };
    double c[3][3] = { {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0} };
    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;

    // Perform GEMM operation
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double*)a, lda, (double*)b, ldb, beta, (double*)c, ldc);

    // Print result
    printf("Result matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanations:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The `gemm_parallel` function defines the parameters required for the GEMM operation: matrix dimensions `m`, `n`, and `k`, the scalar multipliers `alpha` and `beta`, input matrices `a` and `b`, and output matrix `c`, as well as the leading dimensions of each matrix (`lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`).

2. **OpenACC Directives:**
   - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])` directive is used to parallelize the nested loops over `i` and `j` (matrix multiplication loops) and execute them on the accelerator device. The `collapse(2)` clause indicates that two loops are collapsed into one larger iteration space.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause declares that these variables will be private to each thread.
   - `present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])` clause tells the compiler that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present on the device’s memory.

3. **Matrix Element Access:**
   - Access to the matrix elements `a`, `b`, and `c` is adjusted using the row-major order indexing of C/C++. Specifically, `a[i * lda + l]` accesses the element in the `i`-th row and `l`-th column of matrix `a`, considering the leading dimension `lda`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Example matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined with dimensions 3x3.
   - The `gemm_parallel` function is called with the appropriate parameters to perform the matrix multiplication.
   - The result matrix `c` is printed to the console.

This C/C++ code should be compiled with an OpenACC-capable compiler (e.g., PGI or NVIDIA HPC SDK compilers) to enable the OpenACC parallelization directives.

Output 4:
Certainly! Here is a C/C++ version of the Fortran OpenACC code you've provided that implements a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>  // Make sure to include the OpenACC header if necessary

void gemm_parallel(const int m, const int n, const int k, const double alpha, 
                   const double *a, const int lda, 
                   const double *b, const int ldb, 
                   const double beta, double *c, const int ldc) 
{
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

```

Here are the key points where the Fortran code was mapped to C/C++:

1. **Parameter passing:** In C/C++, array sizes and pointers are passed explicitly. `const` qualifiers are used for inputs that are not modified.
2. **Array indexing:** Fortran arrays are 1-based, and C/C++ arrays are 0-based. Thus, the loops start from 0 instead of 1.
3. **Array storage:** Fortran uses a column-major storage order by default, while C/C++ uses a row-major storage order. The indexing in the C/C++ code (e.g., `a[i * lda + l]` and `b[l * ldb + j]`) respects this convention.

Make sure to compile your C/C++ code with an appropriate OpenACC-enabled compiler (such as PGI/NVIDIA HPC SDK).

If you have any specific compiler flags or additional setup, make sure to follow the guidelines provided by your OpenACC compiler.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code that uses OpenACC to implement the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```cpp
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha,
                   double *a, int lda, 
                   double *b, int ldb,
                   double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Function Signature**: The function `gemm_parallel` takes in integer dimensions `m`, `n`, `k`, scaling factors `alpha` and `beta`, and pointers to matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with their respective leading dimensions `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`.
  
- **Loop Structure**: This function uses nested for-loops to iterate over the matrix elements similar to the Fortran implementation. 
  - The outermost loops iterate over the columns (`j`) and rows (`i`).
  - The innermost loop iterates over the shared dimension (`l`).

- **Array Indexing**: The C/C++ code uses zero-based indexing, hence loops in C start from 0 up to less than the specified dimension.

- **Matrix Access Pattern**: The matrices are stored in row-major order for C/C++ as the language convention.
  
- **OpenACC Directive**:
  - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)`: This directive tells the OpenACC compiler to parallelize the two outer loops and treat the variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` as private to each thread. The `collapse(2)` clause ensures that the two loops are combined and treated as a single loop for the purposes of partitioning work among threads.

This code can be compiled with an OpenACC compliant compiler, such as the PGI (now part of NVIDIA HPC SDK) compiler, to run efficiently on supported parallel hardware, such as GPUs.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code that implements a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenACC.

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The `gemm_parallel` function in C/C++ takes the same arguments as the Fortran subroutine:
    - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
    - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars.
    - `a`, `b`: Input matrices.
    - `lda`, `ldb`: Leading dimensions of input matrices `a` and `b`.
    - `c`: Output matrix (modified in place).
    - `ldc`: Leading dimension of the output matrix `c`.

2. **OpenACC Directives**: The `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` directive indicates that the nested loops over `i` and `j` should be parallelized and that the variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` should be private to each loop iteration.

3. **Matrix Access**: The matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are accessed in row-major order (as typical in C/C++), thus the indexing `a[i * lda + l]` represents `a(i, l)` (i.e., the element at row `i` and column `l` in Fortran), and similarly for matrices `b` and `c`.

### Usage:
To compile and run this code, you need a C/C++ compiler with OpenACC support, such as the PGI compiler or GCC with OpenACC support:

```sh
pgcc -acc -Minfo=accel -o gemm gemm.c
./gemm
```

Make sure to link against any necessary libraries and include flags to enable OpenACC.

### Notes:
- Ensure your development environment supports OpenACC.
- Ensure array bounds and dimensions align correctly when calling this function and whenever you interpret data in matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.


Output 7:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code that implements a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:m*k], b[0:k*n], c[0:m*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Here’s a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Function signature:** The function `gemm_parallel` accepts the matrix dimensions (`m`, `n`, `k`), the scalar values (`alpha`, `beta`), and pointers to the matrices (`a`, `b`, `c`) along with their leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`).

2. **Parallel region:**
   - The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive starts an OpenACC parallel region and applies the parallel loop construct.
   - The `collapse(2)` clause is used to merge the iterations of the `j` and `i` loops, creating a larger iteration space for parallel execution.
   - The `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause ensures these variables are private to each iteration.
   - The `present(a[0:m*k], b[0:k*n], c[0:m*n])` clause indicates that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present on the device, which is often useful in more complex applications where data is allocated and moved between the host and device outside of this function.

3. **Loops:**
   - The outer two loops iterate over the dimensions of the output matrix `c`.
   - The innermost loop calculates the dot product of the respective row of `a` and column of `b`.

4. **Matrix indexing:**
   - For C/C++ arrays represented in row-major order, each element is accessed using the formula `i * lda + l` for `a` and `l * ldb + j` for `b`.
   - The result for each element in `c` is computed as `alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j]`.

This C/C++ OpenACC code will perform in a similar manner to the provided Fortran OpenACC code, leveraging parallelism to accelerate the GEMM operation.

Output 8:
Sure, here's the equivalent C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenACC GEMM code:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, 
                   const double *a, int lda, 
                   const double *b, int ldb, 
                   double beta, 
                   double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Types & Parameters**: The `m`, `n`, `k`, `alpha`, `a`, `lda`, `b`, `ldb`, `beta`, `c`, and `ldc` in C/C++ match the same parameter roles and types from the Fortran subroutine.
2. **Loop Constructs**: The nested `do` loops in Fortran are transformed into `for` loops in C/C++, with loop indexing adjusted to start from `0` instead of `1` to follow C/C++ array indexing conventions.
3. **Array Access**: The array indexing in C/C++ uses row-major order which matches C/C++ conventions (`a[i * lda + l]` instead of `a(i, l)`).
4. **OpenACC Directives**: The OpenACC directives are directly translated with `#pragma` statements in C/C++.
5. **Memory Layout**: Note that `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` represent the leading dimensions of the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively, allowing support for both contiguous and non-contiguous storage.

### Notes:
- **Include `<openacc.h>`**: Ensure you have the OpenACC header file included.
- **Compiling with OpenACC**: To compile the provided code, ensure you are using a compiler that supports OpenACC (like PGI/NVIDIA's `pgcc` or GCC with OpenACC support).

Compile command example (using PGI/NVIDIA compiler):
```sh
pgcc -acc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Or using GCC with OpenACC:
```sh
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This ensures your program utilizes the GPU for the parallel computation specified in the OpenACC directives.

Output 9:
Here's the equivalent C/C++ code using OpenACC to implement the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation. This code performs the same operation as your provided Fortran code.

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Differences and Explanations:
1. **Indexing:** Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C/C++ arrays are 0-based. Adjustments have been made to indexes in the loops and array accesses.
2. **Data Layout:** Fortran uses column-major order for arrays by default, while C/C++ uses row-major order. In this example, it is assumed that `a`, `b`, and `c` follow Fortran's column-major layout even though they are declared in C. The indexing `(i * lda + l)` and `(l * ldb + j)` correctly respects this layout.
3. **OpenACC Directives:** The OpenACC directives remain the same, but the syntax is adapted for C/C++ (`#pragma acc parallel loop`).

Ensure that you compile the code with an OpenACC-compatible compiler, such as PGI or the NVIDIA HPC SDK, using the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC.

Compiling with PGI:

```sh
pgcc -acc -Minfo=accel -fast gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
```

Compiling with NVIDIA HPC SDK:

```sh
nvc -acc -fast gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
```

Both commands will require that the OpenACC runtime is available on your system.

Output 10:
Certainly! Below is the C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code implementing a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
    #pragma acc end parallel loop
}
```

In this C/C++ version, the matrix pointers `a`, `b`, and `c` are assumed to be in column-major order, similar to Fortran (which expects column-major order by default). The indices have been adjusted accordingly while accessing the elements. Here are the key components of the conversion:

1. function signature: The function `gemm_parallel` has the same arguments (though with different ordering as per C/C++ conventions) and types as the Fortran subroutine.

2. pragma directives: `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` is analogous to Fortran OpenACC `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP COLLAPSE(2) PRIVATE(i, j, l, temp)`.

3. Indexing into the matrices: 
   - `a[i * lda + l]` accesses the element `a(i, l)` in Fortran.
   - `b[l * ldb + j]` accesses the element `b(l, j)` in Fortran.
   - `c[i * ldc + j]` accesses the element `c(i, j)` in Fortran.

Remember to include appropriate error checking and validation of input parameters in a production-ready implementation.
