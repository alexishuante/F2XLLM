Output 1:
Here is an equivalent C/C++ code implementing Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) using OpenACC, which can help in offloading computations to GPUs:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    const int n = 5;
    const int nnz = 13;

    // Example sparse matrix (in CSR format).
    float val[nnz] = {10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f, 40.0f, 50.0f, 60.0f, 70.0f, 80.0f, 90.0f, 100.0f, 110.0f, 120.0f, 130.0f};
    int row[n + 1] = {0, 3, 6, 9, 11, 13};
    int col[nnz] = {0, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 2, 1, 3};

    float x[n] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f};
    float y[n];

    // Perform SpMV operation
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Directives**:
    - `#pragma acc parallel loop`: Offloads the outer loop to the GPU.
    - `copyin` directive ensures the input arrays `val`, `row`, `col`, and `x` are copied from the host to the device.
    - `copyout` directive ensures the output array `y` is copied back from the device to the host.

2. **Reduction Directive**:
    - `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])`: This directive ensures that the reduction operation (summing up `val[j] * x[col[j]]`) across different threads is correctly handled.

3. **Memory Management**:
    - The directives manage the memory needed for these arrays, ensuring the data is available on the GPU for computation.

4. **Initialization**:
    - The code initializes an example sparse matrix in CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format and a dense vector, and then performs the SpMV operation on them.

### Compilation:
To compile this code, ensure you have an OpenACC-supported compiler (e.g., PGI compiler). The compilation command might look like:

```sh
pgcc -acc -Minfo=accel -o spmv_spmv_parallel spmv_spmv_parallel.c
```

Adjust the compilation flags based on your specific compiler and system setup.

### Running:
After successful compilation, execute the generated binary:
```sh
./spmv_spmv_parallel
```

This should display the results of the SpMV operation based on the provided example matrix and vector.

Output 2:
Certainly! Below is a version of the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation in C/C++ using OpenACC, equivalent to the provided Fortran OpenMP code:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;

        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Directive Initialization**:
   - The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`).
   - The `present` clause ensures that the arrays `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y` are present on the device.

2. **Reduction**:
   - The `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])` directive is used to handle the reduction operation properly. It ensures that updates to `y[i]` within the inner loop are correctly managed across parallel iterations.

3. **Zero Initialization**:
   - `y[i]` is set to 0.0 before starting the inner loop, similar to the original Fortran version.

4. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:
   - Nested loops traverse through the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix to perform the multiplication and accumulate the results in `y`.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the arrays are correctly allocated and copied to/from the device before/after calling the `spmv_parallel` function if not managed automatically by the OpenACC runtime.
- The `present` clause assumes that the necessary data has already been moved to the device. If the data needs to be explicitly copied, `#pragma acc enter data` and `#pragma acc exit data` directives should be used accordingly in the surrounding code.

Output 3:
Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenMP code for Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), using OpenACC instead. OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model similar to OpenMP but designed to target accelerators like GPUs.

Here's the C++ version of the Fortran code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Function to perform Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV)
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop seq
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    const int n = 5; // Number of rows
    const int nnz = 9; // Number of non-zero entries

    // Example sparse matrix in CSR format
    const float val[nnz] = {10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f, 40.0f, 50.0f, 60.0f, 70.0f, 80.0f, 90.0f};
    const int row[n+1] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9};
    const int col[nnz] = {0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 0};

    // Vector x
    const float x[n] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f};

    // Output vector y
    float y[n];

    // Offload data to the device
    #pragma acc data copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    {
        spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
    }

    // Display the result
    std::cout << "Resulting vector y:" << std::endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << y[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Program Explanation:

1. **Function Definition:** `spmv_parallel` function is defined to perform SpMV where:
    - `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
    - `nnz` is the number of non-zero elements.
    - `val` is the array containing the non-zero values.
    - `row` is the array representing the row pointer in CSR format.
    - `col` is the array representing the column indices in CSR format.
    - `x` is the input vector with which the sparse matrix is multiplied.
    - `y` is the output vector to store the result.

2. **Offloading and Parallelization:**
    - The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive parallelizes the outer loop (over rows `i`).
    - The `#pragma acc loop seq` directive indicates that the inner loop (over non-zero entries `j` within a row) should not be parallelized, preserving the sequential order of accumulation for each row `i`.

3. **Data Management:** The `#pragma acc data` directive is used to manage data transfer between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU). The `copyin` clause specifies data copied to the device and `copyout` specifies data copied back to the host.

4. **Main Function:**
    - Sets example values for the sparse matrix and vector.
    - Calls the `spmv_parallel` function within a data transfer block.
    - Prints the resulting vector `y`.

Compile and run this code with an appropriate compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI, now NVIDIA HPC SDK. Add appropriate compile flags to enable OpenACC, like `-acc` for the PGI or NVIDIA HPC compilers. 

For example:
```sh
pgc++ -acc -Minfo=accel spmv_parallel.cpp -o spmv_parallel
./spmv_parallel
```

Output 4:
Sure! Here's the C/C++ version of the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenACC.

Make sure you have an OpenACC-compatible compiler (`pgcc`, `nvc`, etc.) to compile this code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Declaration of subroutine
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y);

// Definition of subroutine
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop seq
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int n = 4;  // number of rows
    int nnz = 9; // number of non-zero elements

    // Example matrix in CSR format:
    // ( 10 0 0 0 )
    // (  0 0 0 20)
    // ( 30 0 40 0)
    // ( 0 50 0 60)
    float val[] = {10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0}; 
    int row[] = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6};  // row indices
    int col[] = {0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3};  // column indices
    float x[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};  // input vector x
    float y[4];  // output vector y

    // Initialize OpenACC
    #pragma acc enter data copyin(val, row, col, x)
    #pragma acc enter data create(y)

    // Perform SpMV
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Copy result back to host
    #pragma acc update self(y)

    // Print the result
    printf("Result vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    // Cleanup OpenACC
    #pragma acc exit data delete(val, row, col, x, y)

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **SpMV Parallel Function**:
   - **Function Signature**: The `spmv_parallel` function follows the structure of the original Fortran subroutine.
   - **OpenACC Directives**: The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used for parallelism. The `present` clause is specified to indicate that the arrays are already present on the device.
   - **Inner Loop**: The inner loop is sequential (`#pragma acc loop seq`) as it inherently cannot be parallelized due to the accumulation into a single `y[i]`.

2. **Main Function**:
   - **Example Matrix and Vectors**: Defines a small example matrix in CSR format and vectors `x` and `y`.
   - **Data Management**: Data is sent to the GPU and retrieved back using `#pragma acc enter data`, `#pragma acc update`, and `#pragma acc exit data`.
   - **Output**: The resulting vector `y` is printed out.

Make sure to link the OpenACC library when compiling the code, for example with `nvcc`:
```sh
nvcc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c -acc
```

Run the compiled program to see the output of the SpMV operation.


Output 5:
To convert the given Fortran code implementing a Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenMP to C/C++ using OpenACC, follow the steps outlined below. The OpenACC approach is similar in paradigm to OpenMP but targeted for accelerator devices, such as GPUs.

Here's the equivalent C/C++ implementation using OpenACC:

```c++
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma acc parallel loop gang worker present(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;

        #pragma acc loop seq
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Header File Inclusion**:
   - Include the OpenACC header with `#include <openacc.h>`.
   
2. **Function Definition**:
   - Define the function `spmv_parallel` with the same parameters as the Fortran subroutine.
   
3. **OpenACC Directives**:
   - Use the `#pragma acc parallel loop gang worker` directive to parallelize the outer loop over `i`. The `gang` and `worker` clauses specify hierarchical parallelism and mapping across different levels of parallel execution on the target device.
   - Use `present` clause to specify the data that should be present on the accelerator device. This avoids implicit data transfers.
   - The inner loop over `j` is specified with the `#pragma acc loop seq` directive. This indicates that the inner loop should be executed sequentially within each gang of workers.
   
4. **Array Indexing Adjustment**:
   - Note that arrays in C/C++ are zero-indexed, whereas in Fortran, arrays are typically one-indexed. Adjust array indices accordingly to match this difference.

This structure follows closely what was described in the Fortran code but adapted for C/C++ with OpenACC pragmas. The parallelism and loop constructs are maintained to leverage the power of GPUs or other accelerators with OpenACC directives.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is a version of the given Fortran OpenMP code, which performs a Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation, rewritten in C with OpenACC for parallelism.

### C with OpenACC

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop seq 
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of spmv_parallel function. 
    // User is expected to provide appropriate n, nnz, val, row, col, x and y.
    
    int n = 5;
    int nnz = 13;
    
    float val[] = {2.0, 3.0, -1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, -3.0, 6.0, 3.0, -2.0, 7.0};
    int row[] = {0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 13};
    int col[] = {0, 1, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 4};
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
    float y[5];

    // Initialize OpenACC device, allocate memory, and transfer data
    #pragma acc enter data copyin(val, row, col, x) create(y)

    // Call the SpMV function
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Transfer data back from the device
    #pragma acc exit data copyout(y) delete(val, row, col, x)

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Directives**: We use `#pragma acc enter data` and `#pragma acc exit data` to manage the data transfer between the host and the device.

2. **Parallel and Loop Directives**: The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive parallelizes the outer loop. We use `present` clause to indicate which arrays are already on the device.

3. **Sequential Reduction Loop**: The inner loop (which performs the summation) uses the `#pragma acc loop seq` directive to ensure that it runs sequentially within each parallel iteration of the outer loop.

Note that OpenACC directives work at a higher level than OpenMP and are often used to offload computation to GPUs or other accelerators. Make sure to compile this code with an OpenACC-compatible compiler, such as `pgcc` from the PGI compilers, now part of the NVIDIA HPC SDK, or GCC with OpenACC support.

Output 7:
To translate the provided Fortran OpenMP code for Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication (SpMV) into C/C++ using OpenACC, you can follow the structure of the original Fortran code but use C/C++ syntax.

Here's the C/C++ equivalent using OpenACC:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    const int n = 5; // example size of matrix
    const int nnz = 8; // example non-zero elements count
    
    float val[nnz] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80}; // example values array
    int row[n+1] = {0, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8}; // example row array
    int col[nnz] = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4}; // example column array
    float x[n] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}; // example input vector
    float y[n]; // output vector

    // Call the function
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    return 0;
}
```

A few notes on the code:
1. **Data Types**: The original Fortran code uses `real`, which corresponds to `float` in C/C++. If your precision requirements differ, you can use `double`.
2. **Array Indexing**: Fortran arrays are 1-based, whereas C/C++ arrays are 0-based. The loop ranges and data initialization have been adjusted accordingly.
3. **OpenACC Directives**: The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to indicate that the loop should be parallelized by the OpenACC runtime.

You would need to compile this code with an OpenACC-compatible compiler (like PGI/NVIDIA HPC SDK) for parallel execution on an accelerator. Make sure to link the appropriate OpenACC libraries and use the necessary compiler flags, such as `-acc`.

Output 8:
Certainly! Below is an equivalent version of the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) operation implemented in C/C++ using OpenACC. This is suitable for execution on GPU architectures.

```c
#include <openacc.h>

// Function to perform Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV)
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenACC
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop over `i`, distributing the iterations across the available GPU threads.
- The inner loop is not explicitly parallelized since each iteration depends on the summation result. However, OpenACC's efficient kernel generation will handle these inner operations effectively.
- The code assumes zero-based indexing, which is standard in C/C++. In the original Fortran code, 1-based indexing is used, so appropriate adjustments are made.

### Usage:
You can call this function with appropriate parameters, ensuring that the data arrays (`val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y`) are correctly initialized:

```c
int main() {
    // Example parameters
    int n = ...; // number of rows
    int nnz = ...; // number of non-zero entries
    float val[nnz] = {...}; // values of the non-zero entries
    int row[n+1] = {...}; // row pointers
    int col[nnz] = {...}; // column indices
    float x[n] = {...}; // input vector
    float y[n]; // output vector

    // Call the SpMV function
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Use the result stored in y
    ...
}
```

### Compiling:
When compiling this C/C++ code, you'll need an OpenACC-compatible compiler like the PGI/NVIDIA compiler. For example:

```sh
pgcc -acc -o spmv spmv.c
```

This command compiles the `spmv.c` file with OpenACC support. Ensure you have the required compiler and libraries installed for OpenACC to function properly.

Output 9:
Sure! Here is a C/C++ version of the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenACC:

```cpp
#include <stdlib.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- `#pragma acc parallel loop`: This directive tells the OpenACC compiler to parallelize the loop that follows. The loop is distributed among the available processing units (such as GPUs).
- The outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`) is parallelized with OpenACC.
- Inside the loop, the `y[i]` value is initialized to `0.0f`.
- An inner loop iterates from `row[i]` to `row[i+1]-1`, computing the product of `val[j]` and `x[col[j]]` and accumulating it into `y[i]`.

### Note:
Be sure to compile the code with an OpenACC-compatible compiler, such as the PGI (now part of NVIDIA HPC SDK) compiler, using the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support (e.g., `-acc`).

### Example Compilation Command (PGI):
```sh
pgcc -acc -o spmv spmv_parallel.c
```

This code assumes the following:
- The sparse matrix is represented in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.
- `n` is the number of rows in the matrix.
- `nnz` is the number of non-zero elements in the matrix.
- `val` is an array of non-zero values.
- `row` is an array where `row[i]` indicates the start of the non-zero values for row `i` in `val` and `col`.
- `col` is an array of column indices corresponding to the non-zero values in `val`.
- `x` is the input vector.
- `y` is the output vector, which will hold the result after the SpMV operation.

Output 10:
### C/C++ Version of Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) Using OpenACC

The provided Fortran code performs a sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) using OpenMP. Below is a C/C++ version of the same functionality using OpenACC, which is analogous to leveraging GPU acceleration similarly accessible through OpenMP for parallel CPU execution.

```cpp
#include <openacc.h>
#include <vector>

// Function prototype for the SpMV operation
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const std::vector<float> &val, 
                   const std::vector<int> &row, const std::vector<int> &col, 
                   const std::vector<float> &x, std::vector<float> &y);

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const std::vector<float> &val, 
                   const std::vector<int> &row, const std::vector<int> &col, 
                   const std::vector<float> &x, std::vector<float> &y) 
{
    // Initialization of output vector
    y.assign(n, 0.0f);

    // Parallel region using OpenACC

### Explanation:

1. **Data Layout**:
   - `val`: Array of the non-zero values.
   - `row`: Row pointer array.
   - `col`: Column indices array.
   - `x`: Input vector.
   - `y`: Output vector.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Output vector `y` is initialized to zeros.

3. **Parallel Computation**:
   - The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used for parallelization. It specifies that the loop can be executed in parallel.
   - The `present` clause ensures the required arrays are available in the device memory for GPU computation.

4. **Inner Loop**:
   - Each iteration of the outer loop processes a row of the sparse matrix, which involves iterating over the non-zero elements of that row to compute the corresponding entry of the vector `y`.

##### Notes:

- Ensure that OpenACC is properly supported and configured in your compiler.
- The sample data used in the `main()` function is for illustration. Adjust the values and sizes per actual use case.
- Proper synchronization and data moving clauses might be necessary depending on the specific OpenACC implementation and hardware in use.

This C/C++ code translates the same parallel structure and logic from the provided Fortran OpenMP code using OpenACC for C/C++ to leverage GPU parallelism for the SpMV operation.
