Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(nthreads) private(i, j, k, iter)

          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[i][j][k] = 0.125 * (u[i-1][j][k] + u[i+1][j][k] + u[i][j-1][k] +
              u[i][j+1][k] + u[i][j][k-1] + u[i][j][k+1] + u[i][j][k]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc barrier
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to pointers to pointers (***u) to represent the 3D array, and we need to explicitly allocate memory for the arrays. Also, the loop collapse clause is used to collapse the three nested loops into a single loop, which can be parallelized.
Also, the #pragma acc barrier directive is used to ensure that all threads have finished the computation before copying the values from unew to u.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(nthreads) vector_length(1) private(i, j, k, iter)

              (*u)[i][j-1][k] + (*u)[i][j+1][k] + (*u)[i][j][k-1] +
              (*u)[i][j][k+1] + (*u)[i][j][k]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc wait
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            (*u)[i][j][k] = (*unew)[i][j][k];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to pointers to pointers (***) to represent 3D arrays, and we need to dereference them using * operator. Also, we use #pragma acc directives to specify the parallelization and data movement.
To compile this code, you need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI or GCC. You may also need to link against the OpenACC runtime library.
You can call this function in a similar way as the Fortran subroutine, passing in the 3D arrays u and unew, the dimensions n, the number of iterations niter, and the number of threads nthreads.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(nthreads) private(i, j, k, iter)
  {
    #pragma acc loop gang
    for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
              u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc barrier
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            u[k][j][i] = unew[k][j][i];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to pointers to pointers (double ***) to represent the 3D array, and we need to explicitly specify the loop collapse and gang parallelism in the OpenACC directives.
Also, the private clause in OpenACC is used to specify that the variables i, j, k, and iter are private to each gang, and the barrier directive is used to ensure that all gangs have finished computing the new values before updating the original array u.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double *****u, double *****unew, int n, int niter) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
          (*unew)[i][j][k] = 0.125 * ((*u)[i-1][j][k] + (*u)[i+1][j][k] + 
            (*u)[i][j-1][k] + (*u)[i][j+1][k] + (*u)[i][j][k-1] + (*u)[i][j][k+1] + (*u)[i][j][k]);
        }
      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc copyout(u[:n][:n][:n])
    *u = *unew;
  }
}
Note that the Fortran code uses coarrays, which are not directly equivalent in C. The double ***** in the C code is a simplification, and you may need to adjust it depending on your actual data structure.
Also, the OpenACC directives in C are slightly different from those in Fortran. The gang vector clause is used to specify the parallelism across gangs and vectors, and the wait directive is used to ensure that all computations are finished before copying the data back to the host.
You can call this function in a similar way as the Fortran subroutine, with the appropriate memory allocation and data initialization.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {

  {
    #pragma acc loop gang
    for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
                                       u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc loop gang
      for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            u[k][j][i] = unew[k][j][i];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to pointers to pointers (double ***) to represent the 3D array, and we need to explicitly allocate memory for the arrays u and unew. Also, the collapse(3) clause in the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to collapse the three nested loops into a single loop, which can be parallelized.
Also, the num_gangs clause in the #pragma acc parallel directive specifies the number of gangs (or teams) to use, which is equivalent to the number of threads in OpenMP.
You can call this function in a similar way to the Fortran subroutine, by passing the addresses of the arrays u and unew, the size n, the number of iterations niter, and the number of threads nthreads.

                                          (*u)[i][j][k]);

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, 3D arrays are not native, so the function uses triple pointers to represent the 3D arrays. Also, the #pragma acc init device directive is used to initialize the device (GPU) before the computation. The #pragma acc parallel directive specifies the parallelization strategy, and the #pragma acc loop directives specify the loops that are parallelized. The #pragma acc wait directive is used to ensure that all computations are finished before updating the u array.

      }
    }
  }
}
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, and it does not support dynamic memory allocation. Therefore, the u and unew arrays must be allocated and deallocated outside of this function.
Also, note that the kind=8 in Fortran corresponds to double in C. The *** in the function parameters is used to represent 3D arrays, and the #pragma acc data copy directive is used to copy data from the host to the device. The #pragma acc parallel directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directives are used to distribute the work among the threads. The #pragma acc wait directive is used to ensure that all threads have finished the computation before moving on to the next iteration.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>

void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter) {

 #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(n) vector_length(32) copy(u, unew)
  {

          #pragma acc loop vector
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            (*u)[i][j][k] = (*unew)[i][j][k];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to pointers to pointers (**u) to represent the 3D array, and we need to dereference the pointers using the () operator. Also, the num_gangs and vector_length clauses are used to specify the parallelization strategy, and the copy clause is used to copy the data to the device.
Also, the wait directive is used to ensure that the computation is finished before updating the u array.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
  int n = 100;
  int niter = 10;
  double ***u = malloc(sizeof(double ***) * n);
  double ***unew = malloc(sizeof(double ***) * n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    u[i] = malloc(sizeof(double **) * n);
    unew[i] = malloc(sizeof(double **) * n);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      u[i][j] = malloc(sizeof(double *) * n);
      unew[i][j] = malloc(sizeof(double *) * n);
      for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        u[i][j][k] = 0.0;
        unew[i][j][k] = 0.0;
      }
    }
  }
  jacobi_parallel(u, unew, n, niter);
  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the u and unew arrays and initializes them to zero. Then it calls the jacobi_parallel function to perform the Jacobi operation.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double *u, double *unew, int n, int niter) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  for (iter = 0; iter < niter; iter++) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (k = 1; k < n - 1; k++) {
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for (j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
          unew[i*n*n + j*n + k] = 0.125 * (u[(i-1)*n*n + j*n + k] + u[(i+1)*n*n + j*n + k] +
            u[i*n*n + (j-1)*n + k] + u[i*n*n + (j+1)*n + k] +
            u[i*n*n + j*n + (k-1)] + u[i*n*n + j*n + (k+1)] + u[i*n*n + j*n + k]);

      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc memcpy(u, unew, n*n*n*sizeof(double))
  }
}
Note that OpenACC uses directives to guide the compiler in parallelizing the code, whereas OpenMP uses pragmas. Also, OpenACC is designed for parallelization on accelerators such as GPUs, whereas OpenMP is designed for parallelization on CPUs.
In this code, #pragma acc parallel loop is used to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop vector is used to parallelize the inner loops. The gang and vector clauses are used to specify the parallelization strategy.
The #pragma acc wait directive is used to ensure that all computations have finished before copying the data from unew back to u. The #pragma acc memcpy directive is used to perform the data copy.
Note that this code assumes that the arrays u and unew are already allocated and initialized on the device. If that's not the case, you'll need to add additional directives to manage the data transfer between host and device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double *u, double *unew, int n, int niter) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
          unew[i + j*n + k*n*n] = 0.125 * (u[(i-1) + j*n + k*n*n] + u[(i+1) + j*n + k*n*n] +
            u[i + (j-1)*n + k*n*n] + u[i + (j+1)*n + k*n*n] + u[i + j*n + (k-1)*n*n] +
            u[i + j*n + (k+1)*n*n] + u[i + j*n + k*n*n]);
        }
      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc copyout(u[0:n*n*n], unew[0:n*n*n])
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so we need to adjust the indices accordingly. Also, OpenACC does not have a direct equivalent to the Barrier directive in OpenMP, but we can achieve the same effect by using #pragma acc wait to ensure that all threads have finished computing before copying the data back to the host.
