Output 1:
Sure, here is the C equivalent of your Fortran subroutine implemented using OpenMP for parallelization to compute the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) shared(a, b, c)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) shared(a, b, c)` directive ensures that both the `i` and `j` loops are parallelized and that the loop variables (`i`, `j`, `l`) and the temporary variable (`temp`) are private to each thread. The matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are shared between threads.
- Matrix elements are accessed via row-major indexing as C uses row-major order while Fortran uses column-major order. Specifically, the element `a(i, l)` in Fortran is accessed as `a[i * lda + l]` in C, where `lda` is the leading dimension of `a`.

To compile the above code, you might use a command like:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```
Ensure you have OpenMP enabled in your compiler, which is indicated by the `-fopenmp` flag for GCC.

Output 2:
Sure, I can provide you with a C function that accomplishes the same Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP for parallelization. Here's a C implementation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double **a, int lda, double **b, int ldb, double beta, double **c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i][l] * b[l][j];
            }
            c[i][j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Array Indices**: Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C arrays are 0-based. Adjustments have been made accordingly.
2. **Matrix Layout**: This code assumes that `a`, `b`, and `c` are dynamically allocated 2D arrays (pointers to pointers).
3. **OpenMP Directive**: `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)` is used to parallelize the two outermost loops, ensuring each thread has its private variables.

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s an example of how you might set up and call this function in a larger program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double **a, int lda, double **b, int ldb, double beta, double **c, int ldc);

int main() {
    int m = 4, n = 4, k = 4;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;

    // Allocate and initialize matrices a, b, and c
    double **a = (double **)malloc(m * sizeof(double *));
    double **b = (double **)malloc(k * sizeof(double *));
    double **c = (double **)malloc(m * sizeof(double *));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        a[i] = (double *)malloc(k * sizeof(double));
        c[i] = (double *)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        b[i] = (double *)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    }

    // Initialize matrices (example initialization)
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            a[i][j] = i + j;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            b[i][j] = i - j;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            c[i][j] = 0.0;
        }
    }

    // Perform GEMM
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, k, b, n, beta, c, n);

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        free(a[i]);
        free(c[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        free(b[i]);
    }
    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(c);

    return 0;
}
```

This example initializes three matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, calls the `gemm_parallel` function, and then prints the result. Remember to link with the OpenMP library (e.g., `-fopenmp` flag with GCC) when compiling.

Output 3:
Sure! Below is a C implementation of the GEMM operation with OpenMP for parallelization:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **OpenMP Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` is used to collapse the two outer loops (`j` and `i`) and parallelize them.
- **Parameters**:
  - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
  - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars for the operation.
  - `a`: Matrix A with leading dimension `lda`.
  - `b`: Matrix B with leading dimension `ldb`.
  - `c`: Matrix C (result) with leading dimension `ldc`.

### Notes:
1. **Memory Layout**: 
   - In C, arrays are row-major, while in Fortran, they are column-major. So, indices are adjusted accordingly.
   - `a[i * lda + l]` accesses the element `(i, l)` of matrix `A`.
   - `b[l * ldb + j]` accesses the element `(l, j)` of matrix `B`.
   - `c[i * ldc + j]` accesses the element `(i, j)` of matrix `C`.

2. **OpenMP**: Make sure to compile the C code with OpenMP support, usually with the `-fopenmp` flag for GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
   ```

This provides a parallelized matrix multiplication using OpenMP similar to the parallelization provided by OpenACC in the given Fortran code.

Output 4:
Sure, here is a function in C using OpenMP that performs the same Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation as described in the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;

    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature:**
   - The function name is `gemm_parallel`.
   - Parameters:
     - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
     - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalar multipliers.
     - `double *a`: Pointer to the first matrix `a` with dimensions `lda` by `k`.
     - `int lda`: Leading dimension of matrix `a`.
     - `double *b`: Pointer to the second matrix `b` with dimensions `ldb` by `n`.
     - `int ldb`: Leading dimension of matrix `b`.
     - `double *c`: Pointer to the matrix `c` which will be updated.
     - `int ldc`: Leading dimension of matrix `c`.

2. **OpenMP Directives:**
   - `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l)`: This directive tells the OpenMP runtime to initialize a parallel region where the outer two loops (indexed by `j` and `i`) will be collapsed and executed in parallel. Each thread will have private copies of the loop variables `i`, `j`, and `l`. This closely mirrors the OpenACC `PARALLEL LOOP COLLAPSE(2) PRIVATE(i, j, l, temp)` directive.

3. **Matrix Indices:**
   - The matrix elements are accessed using pointers and considering the leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`) to correctly handle the layout in memory.

4. **Computing GEMM:**
   - For each element `(i, j)` of the resulting matrix `c`, a temporary variable `temp` is used to accumulate the sum of the product of the corresponding elements from matrices `a` and `b`.
   - The result is then updated in matrix `c` using the formula `c(i, j) = alpha * temp + beta * c(i, j)`.

By using the `collapse` clause, the two outer loops (`j` and `i`) are combined into a single loop to be iterated over in parallel, allowing for better work distribution and potentially more efficient execution.

Output 5:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function using OpenMP for the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) // Equivalent to !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP COLLAPSE(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i*lda + l] * b[l*ldb + j];
            }
            c[i*ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i*ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```
### Explanation

- **Loop Transformation**: In C, arrays are zero-indexed, whereas they are one-indexed in Fortran. Hence, loops in C run from `0` to `n-1`, `m-1`, etc.
  
- **Parallel Directives**: The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` directive is used to parallelize the two outer loops `j` and `i`, similar to how `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP COLLAPSE(2)` works in the Fortran code.

- **Array Indexing in C**: The Fortran 2D array indexing `a(i, l)` is translated to `a[i*lda + l]` in C to properly access elements in a flattened 1D array representation.

### Compilation and Execution
To compile the code with OpenMP support in a Unix-like system, you typically use `-fopenmp` flag with `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
./gemm_parallel
```

### Notes

1. **Thread Safety**: OpenMP handles private and shared variables to ensure thread safety. The `private` clause specifies that each thread should have its own instance of the specified variables.

2. **Performance Tuning**: Depending on your hardware and problem size, you might want to experiment with different OpenMP scheduling strategies (`static`, `dynamic`, etc.) for better performance.

3. **Memory Layout**: Ensure that the memory layout in C matches the expected layout. In Fortran, multi-dimensional arrays are stored in column-major order, while in C, they are stored in row-major order. Consequently, always ensure the correct access pattern to avoid errors.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function utilizing OpenMP to perform the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype for GEMM
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc);

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[3*3] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0}; // 3x3 matrix
    double b[3*3] = {9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0}; // 3x3 matrix
    double c[3*3] = {0.0}; // 3x3 result matrix initialized to 0

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, 3, b, 3, beta, c, 3);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%lf ", c[i * 3 + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization and Input Parameters**:
    - `m`, `n`, `k` denote the dimensions of matrices.
    - `alpha` and `beta` are scalar multipliers.
    - `a`, `b`, `c` are pointers to matrices, where `a` and `b` are input matrices, and `c` is the result/output matrix.
    - `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are the leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)`: This parallelizes the outer loops over `j` and `i` (2-level nested loops) using OpenMP.
    - The `private` clause ensures each thread has its own copy of the loop variables and temporary variable `temp`.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**:
    - The inner loop over `l` computes the dot product of the `i`-th row of `a` and `j`-th column of `b`, storing the result in `temp`.
    - The final value of `temp` is then used to update the element of matrix `c` using the formula `c(i, j) = alpha * temp + beta * c(i, j)`.

4. **Matrix Elements Access Pattern**:
    - Array elements in C are accessed using row-major order. Index calculations like `a[i * lda + l]` and `b[l * ldb + j]` correspond to the `i`-th row and `l`-th column in matrix `a`, and `l`-th row and `j`-th column in matrix `b`, respectively.

5. **Result Printing**:
    - The main function initializes matrices and calls the `gemm_parallel` function.
    - After the computation, the resulting matrix `c` is printed row by row.

### Notes
- Make sure you compile the program with OpenMP enabled (e.g., using `-fopenmp` flag with `gcc`).
- You can adjust the dimensions, input matrices, and scalar values as needed for different test cases.

Output 7:
Below is the C implementation of the generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) function using OpenMP for parallelism. The function signature follows the common C conventions for matrix operations. This implementation is modeled after the provided Fortran and OpenACC code.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the loops using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
    - `int m, n, k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
    - `double alpha, beta`: Scalars used in the GEMM operation.
    - `double *a, *b, *c`: Pointers to the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    - `int lda, ldb, ldc`: Leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **OpenMP Parallelism**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)`:
      - `parallel for collapse(2)`: Parallelizes the nested loops over `i` and `j`.
      - `private(i, j, l, temp)`: Specifies the private variables for each thread to avoid race conditions.

3. **Matrix Access**:
    - In C, the matrices are stored in row-major order, and we use the appropriate indexing `i * lda + l` and `j * ldb + l` to access the elements.

4. **Computation**:
    - A temporary variable `temp` is used to accumulate the product of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
    - The result is then scaled by `alpha` and added to the scaled existing element of `c` multiplied by `beta`.

### How to Compile:
Use a C compiler with OpenMP support to compile this function. For example, using GCC:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This will compile the code with OpenMP directives enabled, allowing it to execute in parallel on multi-core systems. Make sure to link with suitable libraries if your application uses additional dependencies.

Output 8:
Certainly! Below is a C implementation using OpenMP that performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) similar to the Fortran subroutine you provided:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, 
                   double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, 
                   double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l) shared(a, b, c)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    
    double a[9] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; // 3x3 matrix
    double b[9] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}; // 3x3 matrix
    double c[9] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}; // 3x3 matrix
    
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, 3, b, 3, beta, c, 3);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%lf ", c[i * 3 + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We keep the same variable names for consistency.
- The OpenMP `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` is used to parallelize the outer two loops.
- In the nested loops, we compute the `temp` value for each element of the resulting matrix and store the value in `c`.

You should compile this code with an OpenMP-aware compiler by adding the `-fopenmp` flag (for GCC). For example:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
```

This will enable the parallel execution of the loops, thus utilizing multiple processors/cores if available.

Output 9:
Certainly! Here's an equivalent function in C using OpenMP to parallelize the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation. This should achieve similar functionality to the provided Fortran subroutine with OpenACC directives.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;
    double a[9] = {1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9}; // 3x3 matrix
    double b[9] = {9, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1}; // 3x3 matrix
    double c[9] = {0};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

    // Printing the resultant matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * m + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- We are using the `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` directive to parallelize the nested loops over `j` and `i`.
- `collapse(2)` allows the two loops to be merged into a single loop which can be parallelized more effectively.
- The `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of the loop index variables `i`, `j`, and `l` and the temporary variable `temp`.

### Note:
1. `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are the leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.
2. The function initializes the temporary variable `temp` to zero before accumulating the dot product of the row from `a` and the column from `b`.
3. The resulting value of each element in `c` is computed using the formula `c(i, j) = alpha * temp + beta * c(i, j)`.

This C implementation leverages OpenMP to parallelize the GEMM operation, just as the original Fortran subroutine did with OpenACC. Make sure to compile the C code with OpenMP support (e.g., using `gcc -fopenmp`).

Output 10:
Here's a translation of the Fortran subroutine using OpenACC into a C function using OpenMP for parallelized computation of the Generalized Matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double **a, int lda, double **b, int ldb, double beta, double **c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i][l] * b[l][j];
            }
            c[i][j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Include the OpenMP header**: We include the header file `omp.h` which is essential for OpenMP directives.

2. **Function Parameters**:
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars used in the GEMM computation.
   - `a` and `b`: Input matrices with dimensions `lda x k` and `ldb x n`, respectively.
   - `c`: The result matrix which will be updated, with dimension `ldc x n`.
   - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **OpenMP Parallel Directive**:
   - We use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the nested loops.
   - The `private` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of the loop variables and the `temp` variable.
   - The `collapse(2)` clause combines the two outer loops (`i` and `j`) into a single parallel loop.

4. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loops iterate over the dimensions `m` and `n`.
   - The innermost loop computes the dot product for a given row of `a` and column of `b`.
   - Intermediate result `temp` is computed for each element of `c`.

5. **Matrix Update**:
   - Each element `c[i][j]` is updated with the computed value using the formula `c(i, j) = alpha * temp + beta * c(i, j)`.

### Note:

- Matrix indices in C are zero-based whereas in Fortran they are one-based, so the loops' bounds are adjusted accordingly.
- Ensure that the input matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are allocated and deallocated properly in the calling function.
- The given dimensional parameters (`m`, `n`, `k`, `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`) must align correctly with the actual array dimensions in the calling function.

This implementation leverages OpenMP for parallelizing the computation across multiple threads, similar to how OpenACC is used for GPU parallelism in the original Fortran subroutine.
