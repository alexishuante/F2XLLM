Output 1:
Certainly! Here's a C function that computes a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation, parallelized with OpenACC. This function mimics the behavior of the provided Fortran subroutine with OpenMP:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k,
                   double alpha, double *a, int lda,
                   double *b, int ldb,
                   double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) independent
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `gemm_parallel` takes matrix dimensions and scalars `alpha` and `beta` as arguments.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are pointers to the matrices.
   - `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are the leading dimensions for matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

2. **OpenACC Directives**:
   - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) independent`: This directive tells the OpenACC compiler to parallelize the outer loops. `collapse(2)` means to collapse the two nested loops (over `j` and `i`) into a single loop for parallel execution.
   - `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)`: This directive specifies that the inner loop over `l` should perform a reduction operation on `temp`.

Feel free to modify the code or ask for any additional information on this function.

Output 2:
Sure! Below is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenACC to perform the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example use case
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    
    double a[9] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
    double b[9] = { 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
    double c[9] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };

    // Allocate memory on the device
    #pragma acc data copyin(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n]) copy(c[0:ldc*n])
    {
        gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
    }

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **OpenACC Directives**:
    - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(...)`:
        - This directive parallelizes the outer two loops (`i` and `j` loops in this case) across the GPU threads.
        - `collapse(2)` means that the two loops immediately following the directive are collapsed into a single iteration space, allowing for more efficient parallel execution.
        - `present(...)` specifies which arrays are already present in the device memory. This avoids unnecessary data transfer.

2. **Memory Management**:
    - `#pragma acc data copyin(...) copy(...)`:
        - `copyin(...)` transfers `a` and `b` from the host to the device before executing the parallel region.
        - `copy(...)` transfers `c` back to the host after the computation completes.
        
3. **Indexing**:
    - Note that C arrays are zero-based, so loops run from `0` to `m-1`, `0` to `n-1`, and `0` to `k-1`.
    
4. **Matrix Multiplication**:
    - In the `gemm_parallel` function, matrix multiplication is performed using three nested loops similar to the Fortran subroutine.

5. **Execution**:
    - The `gemm_parallel` function is called within a data region to ensure data transfer to and from the GPU is managed.

This code demonstrates how to convert a Fortran subroutine that uses OpenMP for parallelization to a C function that uses OpenACC for GPU acceleration.

Output 3:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC that performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation similar to the Fortran subroutine you provided:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k,
                   double alpha, double* a, int lda,
                   double* b, int ldb,
                   double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Headers**: Required headers `<stdio.h>` for basic input-output functions and `<openacc.h>` for OpenACC functionalities.
- **Function Signature**: Matches the Fortran subroutine's signature as closely as possible in C.
- **`present` clause**: Specifies that arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present in the GPU memory.
- **Collapsing Loops**: The `collapse(2)` clause combines the two outer loops, which helps spread the work more evenly across the GPU.
- **Reduction Clause**: The `reduction(+:temp)` clause is used in the innermost loop to safely accumulate `temp` across threads.

This function can be compiled using an OpenACC-supporting compiler like PGI/NVIDIA HPC compilers. Here is an example compilation command:

```sh
pgcc -acc -Minfo=accel -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Make sure that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are properly managed and allocated in the GPU memory scope (inside `present` regions) if you're running this in a larger codebase.

Output 4:
Sure, here's an equivalent function in C using OpenACC to perform the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda,
                   double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) copyin(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n]) copy(c[0:ldc*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **OpenACC Directives**: 
    - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)`: This directive parallelizes the two outer loops (`i` and `j` loops) and collapses them into a single loop for parallel execution.
    - `copyin(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n])` indicates that arrays `a` and `b` should be copied to the device (GPU) memory from the host memory.
    - `copy(c[0:ldc*n])` suggests that array `c` should be copied to the device at the start of the parallel region and copied back to the host at the end of the parallel region after the computations are finished.

2. **Loop Structure**:
    - The main computation involves three nested loops where the outermost loop iterates over columns `j` of matrix `C`, the middle loop iterates over rows `i` of matrix `C`, and the innermost loop performs the dot product of the respective row of `A` and column of `B`.

3. **Matrix Access**:
    - The matrices `A`, `B`, and `C` are accessed in a row-major fashion as per standard C array indexing. 
    - For example, the element `A[i][l]` in a two-dimensional Fortran array with leading dimension `lda` is accessed as `a[i * lda + l]` in C.

By converting the Fortran OpenMP parallel loop into an equivalent OpenACC directive in C, this function will utilize the GPU for parallel computation of the GEMM operation if a suitable accelerator is available.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC for the provided Fortran subroutine with OpenMP that performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM):

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of some specific elements in the C code:
- The function `gemm_parallel` accepts parameters similar to the Fortran subroutine, including dimensions and leading dimensions of the matrices.
- The matrices (`a`, `b`, and `c`) are expected to be in column-major order, as in Fortran.
- `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)` is used to parallelize the outer two loops over the dimensions `m` and `n`.
- `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)` is used to parallelize the innermost loop with a reduction operation on the variable `temp`.

To use this function, ensure that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are present on the device or managed by the OpenACC runtime. You may have to manage data transfer explicitly if necessary, depending on your specific setup and environment.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is a translation of the given Fortran subroutine that computes a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) into C with OpenACC:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 
                  4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 
                  7.0, 8.0, 9.0};

    double b[] = {9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 
                  6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 
                  3.0, 2.0, 1.0};

    double c[] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0,

                  0.0, 0.0, 0.0};

    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;

    #pragma acc data copyin(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n]), copy(c[0:ldc*n])
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);

    printf("Resulting matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this C version using OpenACC:

1. The `gemm_parallel` function corresponds to the Fortran subroutine. The OpenACC `#pragma` directives are used for parallelism.
2. The `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)` directive is used to parallelize the nested `for` loops that iterate over `i` and `j`. The `collapse(2)` clause is used to specify that the two outermost loops should be collapsed into one single loop for parallel execution.
3. The `private` clause declares the `i, j, l, temp` variables as private to each parallel thread.
4. The `present` clause ensures that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present on the device when the kernels are executed.
5. In the `main` function, the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are allocated and initialized, and data movement between the host and the device is managed using `#pragma acc data` directives.

Compile the C code with a compiler that supports OpenACC (e.g., PGI or NVIDIA HPC SDK compilers) for proper execution on a compatible device.

Output 7:
Certainly! Below is a C function implemented using OpenACC that performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation. This function corresponds to the provided Fortran subroutine.

```c

            }
            c[i*ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i*ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: 
   The function `gemm_parallel` takes in matrix dimensions (`m`, `n`, `k`), scalars (`alpha`, `beta`), and pointers to matrices (`a`, `b`, `c`) along with their leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`).

2. **OpenACC Directives**:
   - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)`: This directive tells the compiler to parallelize the two nested loops following it and collapse them into a single loop to expose more parallelism.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)`: These variables are specified as private to each thread.
   - `present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])`: This directive ensures that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are present on the accelerator device.

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loops iterate over matrix indices and perform the GEMM operation.
   - The temporary variable `temp` accumulates the dot product of the row of `a` and the column of `b`.
   - The final result is computed using the scalars `alpha` and `beta` and stored in matrix `c`.

4. **Main Function**:
   - This initializes example matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Calls the `gemm_parallel` function.
   - Prints out the resultant matrix `c`.

Compile this code with an OpenACC compatible compiler such as PGI or NVIDIA's HPC SDK, and ensure you have the device and runtime set up for execution.

Output 8:
Here is an equivalent C function using OpenACC to perform the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation as specified in the Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:m*k], b[0:k*n], c[0:m*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure to compile this code with an OpenACC-compatible compiler (such as PGI or NVIDIA HPC SDK compilers). Additionally, ensure the arrays (`a`, `b`, `c`) are appropriately allocated and initialized, and copied to the device if necessary. The `present` clause in `#pragma acc parallel loop` assumes that `a`, `b`, and `c` are already allocated and present in device memory. Adjust memory management as needed based on your specific use case and OpenACC environment.

Output 9:
Certainly! Here is a function in C with OpenACC that performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation similar to the Fortran subroutine you provided. OpenACC directives are used to parallelize the computation.

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;

            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }

            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - `gemm_parallel` performs the GEMM operation.
   - Parameters:
     - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
     - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars used in the computation.
     - `a`, `b`: Input matrices.
     - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices.
     - `c`: The output matrix that will be updated.
   
2. **OpenACC Directives**:
   - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)`: Specifies that the following nested loops are to be parallelized and collapsed into a single loop for optimization. The `present` clause indicates the arrays are already present in the accelerator's memory.
   - `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)`: Specifies that the loop contains a reduction clause on `temp`. This is necessary to correctly update `temp` in parallel.
   
3. **Matrix Indexing**:
   - C is 0-indexed, while Fortran is 1-indexed. The loops are adjusted accordingly.
   - In C, the matrices are indexed by `i * lda + l` for matrix `a` and `l * ldb + j` for matrix `b`, as opposed to Fortran's `a(i, l)` and `b(l, j)`. This is because matrix `a` is stored in column-major order, and you need to access it in terms of rows and columns appropriate for C with standard pointer arithmetic.

4. **Computation**:
   - It follows the same logic as the Fortran subroutine:
     - Each element of the result matrix `c` is calculated using a temporary accumulator `temp`.
     - `temp` accumulates the product of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
     - The result `alpha * temp + beta * c` is written back to matrix `c`.

Make sure to compile your C code with a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as the PGI compiler or others that provide OpenACC support. For example, using the PGI compiler, you might compile with:

```shell
pgcc -acc -o gemm gemm.c
```

This will ensure that the OpenACC directives are properly handled to generate parallel code for the target accelerator (e.g., GPU).

Output 10:
Certainly! The following is a conversion of the provided Fortran subroutine, which uses OpenMP for parallelization, to a C function that uses OpenACC for parallelization. This function carries out the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

### C Function with OpenACC

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `gemm_parallel` takes the same parameters:
    - `m`: Number of rows in matrices `a` and `c`.
    - `n`: Number of columns in matrices `b` and `c`.
    - `k`: Number of columns in matrix `a` and rows in matrix `b`.
    - `alpha`: Scalar multiplier for the matrix product.
    - `a`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `a`.
    - `lda`: Leading dimension of `a`.
    - `b`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `b`.
    - `ldb`: Leading dimension of `b`.
    - `beta`: Scalar multiplier for matrix `c`.
    - `c`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `c`.
    - `ldc`: Leading dimension of `c`.

2. **OpenACC Directives**:
    - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])`:
        - `parallel loop`: Indicates that the next loop will be parallelized.
        - `collapse(2)`: Combines the next two loops (the `i` and `j` loops) to optimize parallel execution.
        - `private(i, j, l)`: Indicates that the variables `i`, `j`, and `l` are private to each thread.
        - `present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])`: Instructs the compiler that these arrays are already present on the device (GPU) memory. This is necessary to avoid unnecessary data transfers between host and device.

3. **Matrix Calculation**:
    - The iteration over `j` and `i` follows a column-major order which matches Fortran's array storage.
    - The inner loop over `l` performs the dot product of the `i`-th row of `a` and the `j`-th column of `b`.

4. **Data Layout**:
    - In Fortran, arrays are stored in column-major order and 1-based indexing is used. However, in C, arrays are stored in row-major order and 0-based indexing is used.
    - The access `a[i * lda + l]` and `b[l * ldb + j]` follows the same memory layout as the Fortran code.

### Considerations:
- Make sure the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` have been properly allocated and initialized on the device if you're using GPUs.
- The directive `present` assumes these arrays are already available on the GPU. If not, you'll need additional directives to copy data back and forth.

Make sure to include OpenACC libraries and compile with appropriate flags to enable proper acceleration and parallel performance.
