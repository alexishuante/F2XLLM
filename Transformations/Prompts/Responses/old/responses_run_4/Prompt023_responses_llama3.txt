Output 1:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

  hipDeviceSynchronize();
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
This implementation uses the HIP runtime to launch a kernel on the GPU, which performs the GEMV operation in parallel. The gemv_kernel function is executed by multiple threads on the GPU, each of which computes a portion of the output vector y.
Note that this implementation assumes that the matrix A and the vectors x and y are stored in device memory (i.e., on the GPU). You will need to modify the code to handle memory transfers between host and device if necessary.
Also, this is a simple implementation and you may want to add error checking and optimization for your specific use case.

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
This implementation uses the HIP runtime to launch a kernel on the GPU, which performs the GEMV operation in parallel. The kernel is launched with a single block and n threads, where each thread computes a single element of the output vector y.
Note that this implementation assumes that the matrices and vectors are stored in column-major order, which is the default for HIP. If your matrices and vectors are stored in row-major order, you will need to modify the kernel accordingly.
Also, this implementation uses the float data type, but you can easily modify it to use double or other data types as needed.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding

interface
  subroutine gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(c_int), value :: n
    real(c_float) :: A(n, n)
    real(c_float) :: x(n)
    real(c_float) :: y(n)
  end subroutine gemv_parallel
end interface

call gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y)
This assumes that the gemv_parallel function is compiled into a shared library that can be called from Fortran.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: This code assumes that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. Also, the HIP kernel is launched with one block of n threads, where each thread computes one element of the output vector y.
You can compile this code with the HIP compiler (hipcc) and link it with the HIP runtime library (-lhip_runtime).
Also, you can use hipLaunchKernel with hipExtent to specify the size of the block and grid, like this:
hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(256), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
This will launch n blocks of 256 threads each.
You can also use hipLaunchKernel with hipBlockDim and hipGridDim to specify the block and grid size, like this:
hipBlockDim_t blockDim = 256;
hipGridDim_t gridDim = (n + blockDim - 1) / blockDim;
hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, gridDim, blockDim, 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
This will launch a grid of blocks, where each block has 256 threads, and the number of blocks is calculated based on the size of the input vector n.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel_hip(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the Fortran subroutine, but uses CUDA-like indexing and threading.
Also, note that this code assumes that the matrices and vectors are stored in column-major order, as is typical in Fortran. If your matrices and vectors are stored in row-major order (as is typical in C), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
You can compile this code with a command like:
hipcc -o gemv_parallel_hip gemv_parallel_hip.c
And run it with a command like:
./gemv_parallel_hip <n> <A> <x> <y>
Where <n> is the size of the matrix, and <A>, <x>, and <y> are the input matrix, vector, and output vector, respectively.

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this implementation uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that will be executed on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the Fortran subroutine, but uses C-style indexing and pointer arithmetic to access the matrix and vector elements.
To compile and run this code, you will need to use a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) and a GPU that supports HIP. You can also use the hipconfig tool to generate a Makefile that will compile and link the code for you.
Here is an example of how you might call the gemv_parallel function from a C main program:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;

  // Allocate memory for the matrix and vectors
  A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
  x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize the matrix and vectors
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      A[i * n + j] = (float)(i + j);
    }
    x[i] = (float)i;
  }

  // Call the GEMV function
  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

  // Print the result
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%f ", y[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");

  // Free the memory
  free(A);
  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
}
This code will perform a GEMV operation on a 1024x1024 matrix and a vector of length 1024, using the GPU to accelerate the computation. The result will be printed to the console.

    sum = 0.0;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}

The kernel function is similar to the Fortran subroutine, but uses C-style indexing and pointer arithmetic to access the matrix and vector elements.
You can compile this code with the HIP compiler (hipcc) and link it with the HIP runtime library (libhip) to create an executable that can be run on a GPU.
Here is an example of how you can call this function from a C main program:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;
  hipMalloc((void **)&A, n * n * sizeof(float));
  hipMalloc((void **)&x, n * sizeof(float));
  hipMalloc((void **)&y, n * sizeof(float));
  // Initialize A and x
  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
  // Print y
  hipFree(A);
  hipFree(x);
  hipFree(y);
  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory on the GPU for the matrix A and vectors x and y, initializes them with some values, calls the gemv_parallel function to perform the GEMV operation, and then frees the memory.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

This implementation uses the HIP framework to launch a kernel on the GPU, which performs the GEMV operation in parallel. The kernel is launched with n blocks, each with 256 threads, and each thread computes a single element of the output vector y.
Note that this implementation assumes that the matrix A and vectors x and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You will need to modify the code to handle memory allocation and data transfer between host and device.
Also, this is a simple implementation and you may want to add error checking and optimize the kernel for better performance.

You will need to compile this code with a HIP-compatible compiler, such as hipcc, and link against the HIP runtime library.
Also, you can use the hipblasSgemv function from the HIP BLAS library, which is optimized for GPU architectures.
#include <hipblas.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipblasHandle_t handle;
  hipblasCreate(&handle);
  hipblasSgemv(handle, n, A, x, y);
  hipblasDestroy(handle);
}
This way you don't need to worry about the implementation details and you can use the optimized function from the library.
