Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array, since the Fortran code uses real which is typically equivalent to double in C. If you need to use a different data type, you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran. The rest of the code is similar to the Fortran version, with the main difference being the use of C-style indexing (starting from 0) instead of Fortran-style indexing (starting from 1).


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the code accordingly. Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel followed by a for loop, as it is a more concise and expressive way to parallelize the loop.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the loop indices are adjusted to match C's 0-based indexing, unlike Fortran's 1-based indexing.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified variables are shared among threads. Also, I've used the private clause to declare i and j as private variables for each thread.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run to perform the SpMV operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you're using a different precision, you can adjust the types accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, and the default(none) clause to specify that the variables n, nnz, val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads. The private(i, j) clause specifies that the loop indices i and j are private to each thread.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the type for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array, since the Fortran code uses real which is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, I've replaced the intent attributes with the appropriate C syntax, and used #pragma omp directives to specify the parallelization.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C, and I've used the same variable names to make it easier to compare the two implementations. Also, I've replaced the intent keywords with the appropriate C syntax for function parameters. Let me know if you have any questions!


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified variables are shared among threads. Also, I've replaced the do loops with the equivalent for loops, and adjusted the loop indices to match C's 0-based indexing.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and I've used the same variable names to make it easier to compare the two implementations. Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel followed by a for loop, which is a more concise way to parallelize a loop with OpenMP.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified variables are shared among threads. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as private to avoid race conditions.
