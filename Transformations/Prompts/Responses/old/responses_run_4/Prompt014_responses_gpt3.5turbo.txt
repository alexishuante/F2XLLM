Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
``` 

In this C function, we are using OpenACC directives to parallelize the loop iterations and perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation similar to the Fortran subroutine provided.

Output 2:
```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC that performs the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation similar to the subroutine implemented in Fortran with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, we similarly use the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the outer loop using OpenACC. The matrix `A` is accessed using `A[i*n + j]` to ensure correct memory access in a row-major format.

Output 4:
Here's a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the same Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation as the given Fortran subroutine:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop over `i` using OpenACC. It also specifies the data movement for the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` with the `copyin` and `copyout` clauses to ensure the correct data sharing between the host and device.

Please note that the indexing of the arrays in C is different from Fortran, so the indexing for accessing elements in the array `A` is adjusted accordingly to match the Fortran implementation.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
``` 

In this C function, we use OpenACC directives to parallelize the outer loop of the GEMV operation in a similar fashion to the Fortran subroutine.

Output 6:
Here is a C function with OpenACC implementation of the given Fortran subroutine for Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y)
{
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The `present` clause ensures that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are present on the device before entering the parallel region. The rest of the code mirrors the Fortran subroutine for GEMV operation in terms of the computation performed.

Output 7:
Here's a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the same GEMV operation as the given Fortran subroutine:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop (loop over `i`) using OpenACC. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses are used to specify the data movement between the host and device. Remember to compile this code with a compiler that supports OpenACC directives.

Output 8:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenACC for the given Fortran subroutine:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop of the matrix-vector multiplication operation using OpenACC. The `present` clause specifies that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are present on the GPU device.

You can call this C function from your main program to perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation using OpenACC acceleration.

Output 9:
Here is the corresponding function in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n+j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this version, we are using pointers to pass the arrays A, x, and y to the function. The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop of the matrix-vector multiplication operation using OpenACC.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C function implemented with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `present` clause is used to specify that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are present on the device before starting the parallel loop with OpenACC directives.
