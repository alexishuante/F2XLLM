Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback if the parallel version cannot be executed on the device.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is designed for parallelization on accelerators like GPUs, so the performance may vary depending on the device and the specific use case.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the present clause in the parallel directive ensures that the arrays are already allocated and moved to the accelerator device.
To compile, use:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable that can run on a GPU or other accelerator device supported by the OpenACC implementation.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(none) present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc directive ensures that the arrays are present on the device (GPU) before executing the parallel loop.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU to accelerate the SpMV operation.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop seq
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the function should be compiled in sequential mode, and the #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector directive is used to parallelize the outer loop across gangs and vectors. The #pragma acc loop seq directive is used to indicate that the inner loop should be executed sequentially.
You can call this function from your host code and pass the necessary arrays and scalars as arguments. Make sure to allocate the arrays in the device memory using #pragma acc data directive or acc_malloc function before calling the function.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you need double precision, simply replace float with double in the function signature and the #pragma acc directives.
Also, I've used the copyin clause to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the accelerator, and the copy clause to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction(+:y[i]) clause is used to perform a reduction on the y array, which is necessary since each thread is updating a different element of the array.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as PGI or GCC, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made some minor adjustments to the code to make it compatible with C and OpenACC. Specifically, I've changed the function signature to use pointers instead of arrays, and I've added a default(none) clause to the parallel directive to ensure that the compiler doesn't automatically map any arrays to the device.
Also, I've used #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) to perform a reduction operation on the y array, which is equivalent to the OpenMP reduction(+:y) clause. This ensures that the partial sums computed by each thread are properly combined into the final result.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is designed for parallel computing on accelerators like GPUs, so this code will likely run best on a system with a compatible GPU.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can easily change it to double if needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine for the host CPU, while the #pragma acc parallel loop directive parallelizes the outer loop across gangs of threads, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive performs a reduction on the y array.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust it depending on your specific use case and hardware architecture.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used copyin to copy the input arrays to the device, and copy to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the partial sums of y[i].
Keep in mind that this is a straightforward translation, and you may need to optimize the code further for your specific use case.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback or for debugging purposes.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on a GPU or CPU, depending on your system configuration.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays are present on the GPU.
To compile, use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or nvc++, with the -acc flag:
pgcc -acc spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
Or,
nvc++ -acc spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
Run the program on a GPU by setting the ACC_DEVICE_TYPE environment variable:
export ACC_DEVICE_TYPE=nvidia
./spmv_parallel
This will offload the computation to an NVIDIA GPU.
