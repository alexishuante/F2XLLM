Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop private(j)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays, with the matrix A stored in row-major order. Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed.
Here's a brief explanation of the OpenACC directives used:
#pragma acc parallel loop: This directive parallelizes the outer loop across the accelerator (e.g., GPU) threads.
private(j, sum): This clause specifies that the variables j and sum are private to each thread, meaning each thread will have its own copy.
#pragma acc loop: This directive parallelizes the inner loop across the accelerator threads.
private(j): This clause specifies that the variable j is private to each thread.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, and the compiler will generate the necessary code to execute the parallel loops on the accelerator.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to adjust the indexing accordingly. Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive tells the compiler to perform a reduction on the sum variable, which is necessary for the parallelization of the inner loop.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
Or:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 3:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, but you can easily change it to double if needed. Also, I've used the gang vector parallelization scheme, which is similar to the PARALLEL DO directive in OpenMP. The reduction(+:sum) clause ensures that the partial sums are properly reduced across the parallel threads.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI or GCC. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -Minfo=accel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate a CUDA kernel that can be executed on an NVIDIA GPU.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in the C version, I assumed that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. Also, I used float instead of real since C does not have a built-in real type. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double.
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be called from a host or device routine. The #pragma acc parallel loop directive parallelizes the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive performs a reduction on the sum variable.
You can call this function from a host routine, and the OpenACC runtime will take care of executing it on the device (GPU).


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to adjust the indexing accordingly. Also, OpenACC uses #pragma acc directives to specify parallel regions and loops, and kernels is used to specify a parallel kernel. The loop independent clause tells the compiler that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently, and reduction(+:sum) specifies that the sum variable is a reduction variable that is accumulated across all iterations.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 6:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed a column-major storage layout for the matrix A, which is the default in Fortran. If your A matrix is stored in row-major order, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used the gang and vector directives to parallelize the outer loop across multiple gangs and vectors, respectively. This should give you a good starting point for parallelizing the GEMV operation using OpenACC.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible implementation, and you may need to adjust it to suit your specific use case. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, if you need double precision, just replace float with double in the code.
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be called from a host or device routine. The #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector directive parallelizes the outer loop across gangs (blocks of threads) and vectors (threads within a block). The #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive performs a reduction on the sum variable, which is privatized for each thread.
You can call this function from a host code, like this:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;
  // Allocate memory for A, x, and y
  // ...
  #pragma acc data copy(A, x, y)
  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
  #pragma acc wait
  // ...
  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the matrices and vectors, copies the data to the device, calls the gemv_parallel function, and waits for the computation to finish.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the reduction clause is used to parallelize the sum reduction.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed the arrays are stored in row-major order, as is typical in C. Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Here's a brief explanation of the OpenACC directives used:
#pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum): This directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop and make the variables j and sum private to each thread.
#pragma acc loop private(j): This directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop and make the variable j private to each thread.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is designed for parallelizing computations on accelerators like GPUs, so the performance of this code may vary depending on the hardware and compiler used.

Keep in mind that OpenACC is designed for offloading computations to accelerators (like GPUs), so you'll need to have a compatible device and a OpenACC-enabled compiler (like PGI or GCC) to compile and run this code.
