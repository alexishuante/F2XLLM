Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions explicitly, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 10;
    double **A = malloc(n * sizeof(double *));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    }
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    return 0;
}
Don't forget to free the allocated memory when you're done with it!


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions and the array itself as separate arguments, unlike Fortran where the array dimensions are implicit. Also, the array indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, and the intent statements are not needed either, as the compiler can infer the intent of the variables from their usage.
Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables j and sum are private to each thread, and each thread will have its own copy of these variables.
You can call this function by passing the address of the first element of the arrays A, x, and y, and the value of n. For example:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code will compute the matrix-vector multiplication in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions explicitly, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And run it with:
./gemv_parallel
This code will compute the matrix-vector product in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables j and sum are private to each thread.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
Assuming the code is in a file called gemv_parallel.c.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions explicitly, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000; // example size
    double **A = malloc(n * sizeof(double *));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    }
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // use the result in y

    // free memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code uses dynamic memory allocation to create the matrices and vectors, and frees the memory when it's no longer needed.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, so we need to adjust the loop bounds accordingly.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports it, such as GCC, and link with the OpenMP library. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMV operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, whereas in Fortran, they start from 1.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed that the arrays A, x, and y are already allocated and initialized elsewhere in the code. If that's not the case, you'll need to add the appropriate memory allocation and initialization code.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to perform the indexing calculation manually (i.e., A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j)). Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that each thread should have its own copy of the j and sum variables.
