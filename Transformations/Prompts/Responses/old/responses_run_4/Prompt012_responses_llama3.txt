Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator/Accelerator.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
  #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the Accelerator/Accelerator.h header file is not a standard header, it's just a placeholder, you should use the actual header file provided by your OpenACC implementation.
You can also use #pragma acc parallel loop instead of #pragma acc kernels to parallelize the loop, it will give the compiler more freedom to optimize the parallelization.
#pragma acc parallel loop
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
}
You can also use #pragma acc loop gang and #pragma acc loop vector to specify the parallelization strategy.
#pragma acc loop gang
#pragma acc loop vector
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
}
Please note that the above code is a simple implementation, you may need to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void saxpy(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. The const keyword is used to indicate that x is not modified by the function. The present clause in the parallel loop directive tells the compiler that the arrays x and y are already present on the device, so no data transfer is needed.
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that this function should be compiled for the host CPU, not for the device. This is equivalent to the !$acc kernels directive in Fortran.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module:
use iso_c_binding
...
interface
    subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y) bind(c)
        use iso_c_binding
        integer(c_int), value :: n
        real(c_float), value :: a
        real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
    end subroutine saxpy
end interface
...
call saxpy(n, a, x, y)
Note that the bind(c) attribute is used to specify the C binding, and the iso_c_binding module is used to get the correct types for the arguments.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so x and y are declared as pointers to float. Also, the loop index i is declared as an int, which is the standard type for array indices in C.
To compile this code, you would use a command like:
accgcc -fast -acc saxpy.c -o saxpy
This will compile the code with OpenACC support and optimize it for the accelerator device.
You can then call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module:
use iso_c_binding

interface
    subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y) bind(c)
        use iso_c_binding
        integer(c_int), value :: n
        real(c_float), value :: a
        real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
    end subroutine saxpy
end interface

call saxpy(n, a, x, y)
Note that the bind(c) attribute specifies that the subroutine should be called using the C calling convention, and the iso_c_binding module provides the c_int and c_float types that match the C types used in the saxpy function.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the accel.h header file is a fictional representation of the OpenACC header file, which may vary depending on your specific implementation.
To compile this code, you would need to use an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI compiler suite or gcc with the accel plugin. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia saxpy.c
This would generate a CUDA kernel for the SAXPY operation that can be executed on an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C. If you need double precision, you can replace float with double in the C code.
Also, the implicit none statement in Fortran is not needed in C, and the intent attributes are not necessary either, as the function signature already specifies the types and directions of the parameters.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
  #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the accel.h header file is not a standard header, it's a placeholder for the OpenACC header file that you need to include. The actual header file name may vary depending on your OpenACC implementation.
Here's a brief explanation of the code:
The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to generate an OpenACC kernel for the following loop.
The loop iterates over the elements of the arrays x and y, performing the AXPY operation for each element.
The #pragma acc end kernels directive marks the end of the OpenACC kernel.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING feature, like this:
use iso_c_binding

interface
  subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y) bind(c)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(c_int), value :: n
    real(c_float), value :: a
    real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
  end subroutine saxpy
end interface

call saxpy(n, a, x, y)
Assuming you have the C function compiled into a shared library, you can link it to your Fortran code and call the saxpy function as shown above.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. The float * syntax denotes a pointer to a float. Also, the loop index i starts at 0, not 1, as is typical in C.
Also, the Accelerator.h header file is not a standard header file, it's specific to the OpenACC implementation you're using. If you're using a different implementation, you may need to include a different header file. For example, with PGI compiler, you would include accelerator.h and with GCC, you would include openacc.h.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
  #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, but you can change it to double if needed.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify the parallel region, and the for loop is automatically parallelized by the OpenACC compiler.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, if you need double precision, just replace float with double in the code.
Also, the #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop, and the #pragma acc end kernels directive marks the end of the parallel region.
You can use this function in your C code, and OpenACC will take care of offloading the computation to the accelerator (GPU, for example).


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
  #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, but you can change it to double or any other precision you need.
Also, the #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC, and the #pragma acc end kernels directive marks the end of the parallel region.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.
