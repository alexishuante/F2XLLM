Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(float *u, float *unew, int n, int niter) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
          unew[i + j*n + k*n*n] = 0.125f * (u[(i-1) + j*n + k*n*n] + u[(i+1) + j*n + k*n*n] +
            u[i + (j-1)*n + k*n*n] + u[i + (j+1)*n + k*n*n] + u[i + j*n + (k-1)*n*n] +
            u[i + j*n + (k+1)*n*n] + u[i + j*n + k*n*n]);
        }
      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc copy(u[:n*n*n], unew[:n*n*n])
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays u and unew, and replaced the kind=8 declaration with the equivalent C syntax. Also, I've used gang vector parallelism with OpenACC, which is similar to the OMP PARALLEL directive in OpenMP. The wait directive is used to ensure that the computation is finished before copying the data back to the host, and the copy directive is used to copy the data from the device (GPU) back to the host.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU-enabled system.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(nthreads) vector_length(32) private(i, j, k, iter)
  {
    #pragma acc loop gang
    for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
                                       u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc barrier
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            u[k][j][i] = unew[k][j][i];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed u and unew are 3D arrays of doubles, and that the nthreads variable is used to set the number of gangs (i.e., teams of threads) in the OpenACC parallel region. Also, I've used the vector_length clause to specify the vector length of the loop, which can improve performance on devices that support SIMD execution.
Keep in mind that this is just one possible way to implement the Jacobi operation in C with OpenACC, and there may be other approaches that are more efficient or effective depending on your specific use case.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
          unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
                                     u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
        }
      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc copy(u[:n][:n][:n], unew[:n][:n][:n])
  }
}
Note that I've assumed u and unew are 3D arrays of pointers to pointers to double, and that the n and niter arguments are integers. Also, I've used the gang and vector directives to parallelize the loops, and the wait directive to ensure that the computation is finished before copying the data back to the host.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an OpenACC implementation, such as OpenACC-parallel or PGI's OpenACC implementation.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
  int n = 100;
  int niter = 100;
  double ***u, ***unew;
  // Allocate memory for u and unew
  jacobi_parallel(u, unew, n, niter);
  return 0;
}
This code will perform the Jacobi operation for niter iterations on a 3D array of size n x n x n.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(nthreads) vector_length(1) private(i, j, k, iter)
  {
    #pragma acc loop gang
    for (iter = 1; iter <= niter; iter++) {
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
                                       u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc wait
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            u[k][j][i] = unew[k][j][i];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed u and unew are 3D arrays of doubles, and n, niter, and nthreads are integers. Also, I've used the acc routine seq directive to ensure that the routine is executed sequentially on the host, and the acc parallel directive to parallelize the loops on the device. The acc loop gang directive is used to distribute the loops across the gangs (or teams) of threads, and the acc loop gang collapse(3) directive is used to collapse the three nested loops into a single loop that can be parallelized. The acc wait directive is used to ensure that all threads have finished updating the unew array before copying it back to the u array.
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and the code will be executed on a device (such as a GPU) only if the compiler and runtime support it. Also, the performance of the code may vary depending on the device and the input data.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(double *****u, double *****unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {

      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
                                       u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc wait
      #pragma acc loop gang collapse(3)
      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            u[k][j][i] = unew[k][j][i];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed u and unew are pointers to 3D arrays, and I've used the ***** notation to represent this. Also, I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that the function should be compiled in sequence, and the #pragma acc parallel directive to specify the parallelization parameters. The #pragma acc loop directives are used to specify the loops that should be parallelized, and the #pragma acc wait directive is used to ensure that the data is consistent across all threads before updating the u array.
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, and it requires a compiler that supports it, such as PGI or GCC. Also, the code assumes that the arrays u and unew are already allocated and initialized.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(float *u, float *unew, int n, int niter) {

    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
      #pragma acc loop vector
      for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
          unew[i * n * n + j * n + k] = 0.125f * (
            u[(i - 1) * n * n + j * n + k] + u[(i + 1) * n * n + j * n + k] +
            u[i * n * n + (j - 1) * n + k] + u[i * n * n + (j + 1) * n + k] +
            u[i * n * n + j * n + (k - 1)] + u[i * n * n + j * n + (k + 1)] +
            u[i * n * n + j * n + k]);
        }
      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc copy(u[:n * n * n], unew[:n * n * n])
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays u and unew, and replaced the kind=8 declaration with the equivalent C syntax. Also, the nthreads variable is not needed in the OpenACC implementation, as the number of threads is determined by the runtime.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void jacobi_parallel(float *u, float *unew, int n, int niter) {

  {
    #pragma acc loop gang

      for (k = 2; k < n - 1; k++) {
        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[i + j * n + k * n * n] = 0.125f * (
              u[(i - 1) + j * n + k * n * n] + u[(i + 1) + j * n + k * n * n] +
              u[i + (j - 1) * n + k * n * n] + u[i + (j + 1) * n + k * n * n] +
              u[i + j * n + (k - 1) * n * n] + u[i + j * n + (k + 1) * n * n] +
              u[i + j * n + k * n * n]);
          }
        }
      }
      #pragma acc loop gang
      for (int index = 0; index < n * n * n; index++) {
        u[index] = unew[index];
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, you can change it to double if needed. Also, the num_gangs and vector_length clauses are used to control the parallelization, you can adjust them according to your hardware and performance needs.
Also, the copy(u, unew) clause is used to copy the data from the host to the device, you can use present(u, unew) if the data is already present on the device.
You can call this function by passing the pointers to the u and unew arrays, along with the n and niter values.
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  int niter = 10;
  float *u = (float *)malloc(n * n * n * sizeof(float));
  float *unew = (float *)malloc(n * n * n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize u and unew arrays

  jacobi_parallel(u, unew, n, niter);

  free(u);
  free(unew);

  return 0;
}
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void jacobi_parallel(double ***u, double ***unew, int n, int niter, int nthreads) {
  int i, j, k, iter;
  #pragma acc parallel num_gangs(nthreads) vector_length(1) private(i, j, k, iter)

        for (j = 2; j < n - 1; j++) {
          for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            unew[k][j][i] = 0.125 * (u[k][j][i-1] + u[k][j][i+1] + u[k][j-1][i] +
              u[k][j+1][i] + u[k-1][j][i] + u[k+1][j][i] + u[k][j][i]);
          }

          for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            u[k][j][i] = unew[k][j][i];
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to pointers to pointers (***) to represent 3D arrays, and we need to explicitly specify the loop bounds and the parallelization strategy using OpenACC directives. Also, the wait directive is used to ensure that the computation is finished before updating the u array.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:

        #pragma acc loop vector
        for (i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
          unew[i + j*n + k*n*n] = 0.125f * (u[(i-1) + j*n + k*n*n] + u[(i+1) + j*n + k*n*n] +
            u[i + (j-1)*n + k*n*n] + u[i + (j+1)*n + k*n*n] + u[i + j*n + (k-1)*n*n] +
            u[i + j*n + (k+1)*n*n] + u[i + j*n + k*n*n]);

    #pragma acc loop gang
    for (k = 0; k < n*n*n; k++) {
      u[k] = unew[k];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays u and unew, and adjusted the indexing accordingly. Also, I've used num_gangs and vector_length clauses to control the parallelization, and gang and vector loops to distribute the work among the gangs and vectors. Finally, I've used wait directive to ensure that the computation is finished before updating the u array.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq

      }
    }
    #pragma acc wait
    #pragma acc memcpy(u, unew, n * n * n * sizeof(float))
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays u and unew, and replaced the kind=8 declaration with the equivalent C syntax. I've also removed the nthreads argument, as OpenACC doesn't have an equivalent construct to specify the number of threads. Instead, the number of gangs, workers, and vectors is determined by the OpenACC runtime.
Also, the private clause is not needed in OpenACC, as the parallel loop variables are automatically privatized. The SCHEDULE(STATIC) clause is also not needed, as the default schedule is static. Finally, the BARRIER clause is replaced with #pragma acc wait, which ensures that all threads have finished the parallel loop before proceeding.
