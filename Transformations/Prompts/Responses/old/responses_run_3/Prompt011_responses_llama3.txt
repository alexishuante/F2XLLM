Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C. If you're using double precision in Fortran, you should use double in C as well.
Also, OpenACC's parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the loop, similar to OpenMP's parallel do directive.
Make sure to compile with OpenACC support, for example:
gcc -fopenacc saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, if you need double precision, just replace float with double in the function signature and the body.
Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays x and y are present on the device (GPU) before executing the loop.
You can call this function from your host code, and OpenACC will take care of offloading the computation to the device.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily change it to double if needed. Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
This will generate an executable file saxpy_parallel that you can run on a GPU or other accelerator device supported by OpenACC.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily change it to double if needed.
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The parallel keyword is used to specify that the loop should be executed in parallel, and the loop keyword specifies that the loop should be parallelized.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily modify the function to use double precision if needed. Also, the present clause in the parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays x and y are present on the accelerator device.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o saxpy_parallel saxpy_parallel.c
Or:
pgcc -acc -o saxpy_parallel saxpy_parallel.c
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float types for the arrays x and y, and the scalar a. If your arrays are of a different type (e.g. double), you'll need to adjust the types accordingly.
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The parallel clause specifies that the loop should be executed in parallel, and the loop clause specifies that the loop should be parallelized.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the Portland Group, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily modify the function to use double or other precisions as needed.
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The parallel clause specifies that the loop should be executed in parallel, and the loop clause specifies that the loop should be parallelized.
You can compile this function with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenACC.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC with the accel plugin or PGI compiler. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o saxpy_parallel saxpy_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file saxpy_parallel that you can run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback if the OpenACC parallelization is not possible.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding
...
interface
    subroutine saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y) bind(C)
        use iso_c_binding
        integer(c_int), value :: n
        real(c_float), value :: a
        real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
    end subroutine saxpy_parallel
end interface
...
call saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y)
Make sure to compile your C code with OpenACC support and link it with your Fortran code.
