Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the default(present) clause in the Fortran code is not needed in C, as the copyin and copyout clauses imply that the variables are present on the device.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on a device that supports OpenACC.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are present on the accelerator device, while the copyout clause ensures that the result array y is copied back to the host.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a supported accelerator device, such as an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the #pragma acc directive to specify the parallel loop, and the default(present) clause to ensure that the arrays are present on the accelerator device. The copyin and copyout clauses specify which arrays to copy to/from the device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C, and integer corresponds to int. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, unlike Fortran which is 1-based. Finally, the DEFAULT(PRESENT) clause in the Fortran code is not needed in C, as the copyin and copyout clauses will automatically determine the data sizes based on the array sizes.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are present on the accelerator device, and the copyout clause ensures that the result array y is copied back to the host after the computation.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a supported accelerator device, such as an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If your data type is different (e.g., double), you'll need to modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc parallel loop directive to specify the parallel loop, and the default(present) clause to indicate that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are present in the accelerator memory. The copyin and copyout clauses specify the data transfer direction.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler (such as PGI or GCC) and run it on a supported accelerator device (such as an NVIDIA GPU).


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses are used to specify the data that needs to be copied to/from the device memory.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc directive is used to specify the parallel loop, and the copyin and copyout clauses are used to specify the data that needs to be copied to/from the device.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(present) copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the default(present) clause tells OpenACC to use the same data type for the arrays as the original data, and the copyin and copyout clauses specify which arrays to copy to/from the device memory.
You can compile this code with OpenACC support using a compiler like pgcc or nvc++, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that this function can be executed sequentially on the host or on a device with OpenACC.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv spmv.c
This will generate an executable file spmv that can be run on a host or a device with OpenACC support.
