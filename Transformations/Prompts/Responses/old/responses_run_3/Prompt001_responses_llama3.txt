Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop index i starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop, similar to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the following for loop across multiple threads. The for loop is then executed in parallel, with each thread working on a different portion of the loop iterations.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, array indices start at 0, so the loop iterates from 0 to n-1. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, whereas it starts from 1 in Fortran.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
And then call the function saxpy_parallel with the appropriate arguments.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop index i starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop index i starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
And then call the function saxpy_parallel from your main program.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can call this function from your main program, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    // Use the resulting y array...

    free(x);
    free(y);
    return 0;
}
Don't forget to link with OpenMP libraries when compiling your program. The exact flags may vary depending on your compiler and system. For example, with GCC, you can use:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so x and y are declared as pointers to float. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, not 1, as in C arrays are 0-indexed.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
And then call it from your main program, passing the appropriate arguments.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices in C typically start from 0, so I adjusted the loop accordingly.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the appropriate arguments, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile your program with OpenMP support, e.g. using gcc with the -fopenmp flag:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
