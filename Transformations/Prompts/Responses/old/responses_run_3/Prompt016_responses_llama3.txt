Output 1:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM subroutine in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop private(l)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that this function should be compiled for the host CPU, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive to specify the parallelization strategy. I've also used the private clause to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp should be privatized for each thread.
Also, I've used the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c in the parallel loop, assuming that the matrices are stored in column-major order.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as the PGI compiler, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the parallel loop directive tells the compiler to collapse the two outer loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran is equivalent to double in C. Also, the array indices in C are 0-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds and array accesses accordingly.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate a parallel executable that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c respectively. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the function should be compiled in sequential mode, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the loops.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module:
use iso_c_binding
...
interface
  subroutine gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(C_INT) :: m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc
    real(C_DOUBLE) :: alpha, beta
    real(C_DOUBLE) :: a(lda, k), b(ldb, n)
    real(C_DOUBLE) :: c(ldc, n)
  end subroutine gemm_parallel
end interface
...
call gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc)
Note that the bind(C) attribute is used to specify the C binding for the subroutine, and the iso_c_binding module is used to define the C types (C_INT and C_DOUBLE) and to specify the passing of arrays as pointers.


Output 5:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM operation in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used the #pragma acc routine seq directive to indicate that this function should be compiled for the host CPU, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive to specify the parallelization strategy. I've also used the private clause to specify that the loop indices and the temporary variable temp should be privatized for each thread.
Additionally, I've used the #pragma acc loop reduction directive to specify that the inner loop should be reduced using the + operator, which is the default reduction operation for real numbers.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding, only: c_double, c_int

interface
  subroutine gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding, only: c_double, c_int
    integer(c_int), intent(in) :: m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc
    real(c_double), intent(in) :: alpha, beta
    real(c_double), intent(in) :: a(lda, k), b(ldb, n)
    real(c_double), intent(inout) :: c(ldc, n)
  end subroutine gemm_parallel
end interface

call gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc)
Note that you'll need to compile the C code with the -acc flag to enable OpenACC support, and link it with the Fortran code using the -lacc flag.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the lda and ldb arguments are used to stride through the arrays correctly.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays. Also, the reduction clause is used to specify that the temp variable is used to accumulate the results of the inner loop, and the private clause is used to specify that each thread should have its own copy of the temp variable.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used #pragma acc routine seq to indicate that this function is a sequential routine that can be parallelized by the OpenACC compiler. The collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, and the private clause is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread. The reduction(+:temp) clause is used to perform a reduction on the temp variable.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and adjusted the indexing and memory access accordingly. Also, I've used #pragma acc routine seq to ensure the routine is executed sequentially on the host, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) to perform the reduction on the temp variable.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to explicitly calculate the indices using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the seq clause is used to ensure that the inner loop is executed sequentially, as OpenACC doesn't support reductions in parallel loops.
You can compile this function with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator.
