Output 1:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenACC that corresponds to the given Fortran subroutine for Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, we have used the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the loop that computes the SpMV operation using OpenACC. The `present` clause ensures that the necessary data is present on the GPU before starting the computation.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC for the Fortran subroutine spmv_parallel:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop over the rows of the sparse matrix in the C function. The `present` clause is used to specify the variables that are present on the device and need to be copied before the parallel loop.

Note: Make sure to include the necessary OpenACC header files and compiler flags in your C code to enable OpenACC support.

Output 3:
The following is a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs a Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation equivalent to the Fortran subroutine provided:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
``` 

This C function uses OpenACC directives to parallelize the loop over the rows of the sparse matrix and compute the multiplication between the non-zero values of the matrix and the corresponding elements of the input vector `x`. The result is stored in the output vector `y`.

Output 4:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenACC that performs Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, we are using OpenACC directives to parallelize the loop that computes the SpMV operation. The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to instruct the compiler to parallelize the loop iteration over the vector `y` to be computed in parallel across the available compute resources.

Make sure to include the necessary OpenACC header file and compiler flag to enable OpenACC support when compiling this function.

Output 5:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenACC for the subroutine spmv_parallel in Fortran:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

You can call this C function from your main program to perform Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenACC.

Output 6:
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Output 7:
Below is the corresponding C function implemented with OpenACC for the provided Fortran subroutine spmv_parallel:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y) 
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for(j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenACC `parallel loop` directive to parallelize the computation of SpMV operation similar to the Fortran implementation.

Output 8:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that achieves the same Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation as the Fortran subroutine provided:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, we use OpenACC directives to parallelize the loop over the matrix rows. The `present` clause is used to specify that the arrays `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y` are present (i.e., allocated and accessible) on the GPU device. The loop calculates the sparse matrix-vector multiplication operation just like the original Fortran subroutine.

Please note that you may need to adjust data types and indexing based on the specific requirements of your application.

Output 9:
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Output 10:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float* val, int* row, int* col, float* x, float* y) 
{
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This C function is equivalent to the Fortran subroutine `spmv_parallel` when implemented with OpenACC for performing the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication operation.
