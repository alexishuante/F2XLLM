Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the ld* parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the matrices, which is necessary for correct memory access.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports it, such as GCC:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMM operation in parallel using OpenMP.

Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the matrices, which is equivalent to the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters in the Fortran subroutine.

            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }

Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.

            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c respectively. Also, the private clause in the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC, and link it with the OpenMP library. For example:
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMM operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 7:

            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, and the intent attributes are not used. Instead, the function parameters are declared with the appropriate types and the const keyword is used to indicate that the function does not modify the input arrays a and b.

}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters represent the leading dimensions of the matrices, which are used to access the elements of the matrices.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the matrices a, b, and c as pointers, along with their dimensions and the other parameters.
