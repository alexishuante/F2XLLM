Output 1:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, but you can easily modify it to double if needed. Also, I've used the accel.h header file, which is a common way to interface with OpenACC in C.
The #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop. The rest of the code is similar to the Fortran implementation.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran.
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI compiler suite, using the -acc flag:
pgcc -acc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate a parallel executable that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran.
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to tell the compiler that this function should be compiled in sequential mode, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The inner loop is also parallelized using the #pragma acc loop directive.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the appropriate arguments, like this:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;
  // Allocate memory for A, x, and y
  A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
  x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  // Initialize A and x
  // ...
  // Call the GEMV function
  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
  // ...
  return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 4:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C with OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator/Accelerator.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision, but you can easily modify the code to use double or other precisions as needed. Also, I've used the Accelerator header and the #pragma acc directives to enable OpenACC acceleration.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on your system.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 5:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if you need double precision.
You can compile this code with OpenACC support using a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI.
For example:
gcc -fopenacc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran. Also, the routine seq pragma is used to indicate that the routine should be compiled in sequential mode, and the parallel loop pragma is used to parallelize the outer loop.
You can call this function from your main program like this:
int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *A, *x, *y;
  // Allocate memory for A, x, and y
  A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
  x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  // Initialize A and x
  // ...
  #pragma acc data copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copy(y[0:n])
  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
  #pragma acc wait
  // Use the result in y
  // ...
  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the matrices and vectors, initializes them, and then calls the gemv_parallel function with the acc data pragma to copy the data to the device and the acc wait pragma to wait for the computation to complete.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback if the parallel version cannot be executed on the device.
You can call this function on the host or on a device using OpenACC's #pragma acc data and #pragma acc parallel directives. For example:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *A, *x, *y;
    A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize A and x

    #pragma acc data copy(A, x, y)
    #pragma acc parallel
    {
        gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    }

    // Use the result in y

    return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the matrices and vectors on the host, copies them to the device, and then calls the gemv_parallel function on the device using OpenACC's parallel region. The result is then copied back to the host and can be used.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran. Also, the reduction clause is used to specify that the sum variable is a reduction variable, to avoid race conditions in the parallel loop.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are stored in row-major order, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran.
Also, I used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if you need double precision.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the routine should be compiled in sequence, rather than in parallel.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you would use a compiler such as pgcc (from the Portland Group) or gcc (with the OpenACC plugin) and specify the -acc flag, like so:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
Or
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate a parallel version of the GEMV operation that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.
