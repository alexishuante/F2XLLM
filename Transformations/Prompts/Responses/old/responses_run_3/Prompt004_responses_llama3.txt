Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, and the private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable, avoiding race conditions.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
Make sure to link with the OpenMP library using the -fopenmp flag.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to perform the indexing calculations manually. Also, the private clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, like this:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will create an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMV operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are stored in row-major order, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I've used double as the data type, assuming that's what you want. If you need to use a different data type, just replace double with the appropriate type.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array A as a pointer to a pointer (double **A) to represent a 2D array, and we use double as the data type instead of real since C does not have a built-in real type. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as integers.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, and the private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the private clause is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel <n> <A_file> <x_file> <y_file>
Where <n> is the size of the matrix, <A_file> is the file containing the matrix A, <x_file> is the file containing the vector x, and <y_file> is the file where the result will be stored.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, whereas in Fortran they start from 1.

Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrix A. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code assumes that you have already initialized the matrix A and the vector x. The result of the GEMV operation will be stored in the vector y.


Output 9:
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C with OpenMP:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran.
Also, the private clause in the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copy of the sum variable, to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And run it with a command like:
./gemv_parallel <n> <A_file> <x_file> <y_file>
Where <n> is the size of the matrix, and <A_file>, <x_file>, and <y_file> are the files containing the matrix A, the vector x, and the output vector y, respectively.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to explicitly pass the array sizes and use pointer arithmetic to access the matrix elements, whereas in Fortran, the array sizes are implicit and the compiler takes care of the memory management.
Also, the OpenMP directive #pragma omp parallel for is used to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the OpenACC directive $ACC PARALLEL LOOP in the Fortran code.
