Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of the GEMM operation using OpenMP for parallelism. OpenMP is a common way to parallelize C/C++ code and can help in making use of multi-threading capabilities. Here's the equivalent GEMM operation:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <cstdlib>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, const double* a, int lda, const double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[9] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    double b[9] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    double c[9] = {0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5};
    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);

    // Output the result to verify
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Arguments:**
  - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices involved.
  - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalar multipliers.
  - `a`, `b`: Input matrices `a` (m x k) and `b` (k x n).
  - `c`: Resultant matrix `c` (m x n) which is also an input matrix that gets updated.
  - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`.

- **OpenMP Directive:**
  - `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)`:
    - `parallel for`: Parallelizes the nested for loops.
    - `collapse(2)`: Combines the first two loops (`j` and `i`) into a single loop for better load balancing.
    - `private(i, j, l, temp)`: Declares variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` as private for each thread.
    - `schedule(static)`: Distributes iterations in a contiguous block.

- **Indexing:**
  - The arrays in C/C++ are zero-indexed, hence the loops run from `0` to `n-1`, `m-1`, and `k-1` respectively.
  - Matrix elements are accessed using the row-major order which is typical in C/C++.

### Compilation:
To compile this code with OpenMP, you need to enable OpenMP in your compiler. For example, with `gcc` or `clang`:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
./gemm
```

This will compile and run the program, effectively performing the GEMM operation using parallelism.

Output 2:
To translate the given Fortran OpenACC code for a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) into C/C++ with OpenMP, you'll need to implement the same logic and parallelize it with OpenMP directives.

Here's the equivalent C/C++ code:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l) shared(a, b, c)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature & Parameters:**
   - The function `gemm_parallel` is defined with the same parameters as the Fortran subroutine, specifying the matrix dimensions and parameters `alpha` and `beta`.
   - The matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are passed as pointers, and `lda, ldb, ldc` are their respective leading dimensions (row strides).

2. **OpenMP Parallel Directives:**
   - `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l) shared(a, b, c)` is used to parallelize the outer two loops (`i` and `j`).
   - The `collapse(2)` clause specifies that the loops should be collapsed into a single loop for the purpose of partitioning among the threads.
   - `private(i, j, l)` ensures that these loop variables are private to each thread.
   - `shared(a, b, c)` indicates that the matrices are shared among all the threads.

3. **Matrix Multiplication Logic:**
   - The nested loops iterate over the dimensions of the matrices, following 0-based indexing in C (compared to the 1-based indexing in Fortran).
   - The `temp` variable is used to accumulate the partial results of the dot product for each element of the resulting matrix `c`.
   - The final value of each element `c[i * ldc + j]` is computed as `alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j]`, following the same operation as in the Fortran code.

### Note:
Ensure that OpenMP is enabled when compiling the code. If you are using GCC, you can enable OpenMP with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This C/C++ implementation should give you the same functionality and parallel performance benefits as the provided Fortran OpenACC code.

Output 3:
To convert your Fortran OpenACC GEMM code to C/C++ with OpenMP, we need to implement the same matrix multiplication logic using C/C++ syntax and leverage OpenMP directives for parallel execution. Below is an equivalent C/C++ code:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[9] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    double b[9] = {9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1};
    double c[9] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * m + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `gemm_parallel` accepts pointers to matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with their dimensions and scaling factors.
2. **OpenMP Parallelization**: We use `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` to parallelize the nested `for` loops.
3. **Pointer Arithmetic**: C/C++ uses 0-based indexing and requires manual computation of indices for 2D arrays simulated via 1D arrays. For example: `a[i * lda + l]` accesses the element at row `i` and column `l`, assuming `lda` is the leading dimension of matrix `a`.
4. **Matrix Access**: Matrix `c` is updated in-place using the formula `c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j]`.

You can compile the code with `-fopenmp` flag using gcc/g++ for enabling OpenMP:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
./gemm
```

Make sure your environment supports OpenMP and the compiler is correctly installed to run this code.

Output 4:
Certainly! Below is an equivalent C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code using OpenMP for parallelism. The GEMM operation performs matrix multiplication and takes advantage of parallel processing to speed up the computations.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallel region with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 2, n = 2, k = 2;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};  // 2x2 matrix
    double b[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};  // 2x2 matrix
    double c[4] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0};  // 2x2 result matrix

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, 2, b, 2, beta, c, 2);

    // Output the result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * 2 + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature and Parameters:**
   - The function `gemm_parallel` takes the dimensions of the matrices, the scalar multipliers `alpha` and `beta`, and the pointers to the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with their respective leading dimensions.

2. **OpenMP Parallel Region:**
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` directive is used to distribute the iterations of the nested loops over multiple threads.
   - The `collapse(2)` clause is used to collapse the two outer loops into a single loop for better load balancing and parallel efficiency.

3. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - The loops iterate over the dimensions of the resulting matrix `c`, and compute each element as per the matrix multiplication followed by the scaling and addition of the previous value in `c`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - The `main` function demonstrates how to set up example matrices and call the `gemm_parallel` function, printing out the resulting matrix `c`.

This code maintains the correct matrix indexing for C/C++ (0-based indexing versus Fortran's 1-based indexing) and uses OpenMP to parallelize the looping structure effectively.

Output 5:
Certainly! Here's how you can translate the provided Fortran OpenACC code for the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation into C/C++ code using OpenMP:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <cstdio>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda,
                   double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) shared(a, b, c)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;
    double a[9] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0};
    double b[9] = {9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0};
    double c[9] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0};

    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;
    
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
    
    // Print result matrix
    printf("Resulting Matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%1.1f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature:**
   The function `gemm_parallel` computes the matrix product \( C = \alpha \times (A \times B) + \beta \times C \).

2. **OpenMP Directives:**
   The pragma `#pragma omp parallel for` creates a team of parallel threads to work on the loops.
   - `collapse(2)` indicates to OpenMP to collapse (merge) the nested loops into one single loop for parallel execution.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)` ensures that each thread gets its own private instance of these loop indices and the temporary variable to prevent race conditions.
   - `shared(a, b, c)` indicates that the matrices are shared among the threads.

3. **Matrix Indexing:**
   - The code uses row-major indexing for matrices which matches the memory layout used in C/C++.

4. **Example Usage:**
   - An example initialization of matrices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) with specific values.
   - The result is printed out to verify the computation.

### Note:
- This isn't necessarily the most optimized version for high-performance computing, especially for large matrices where you might want to take advantage of blocking techniques and more advanced optimizations.
- Remember to compile the code with OpenMP support, e.g., using `g++`:
  ```sh
  g++ -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.cpp
  ```

This ensures the parallel sections of the code are correctly acknowledged and processed by the OpenMP runtime.

Output 6:
Here is an equivalent version of the Fortran OpenACC code in C/C++ using OpenMP to implement a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```C
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double **a, int lda, double **b, int ldb, double beta, double **c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i][l] * b[l][j];
            }
            c[i][j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Indexing**: C/C++ arrays are zero-based, whereas Fortran arrays are one-based. Ensure that the indices in the C/C++ version start from 0 and adjust loop limits accordingly.
2. **Parallelization**: The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)` directive in OpenMP is used to parallelize the outer two loops (`j` and `i`). This is similar to the `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP COLLAPSE(2) PRIVATE(i, j, l, temp)` directive in OpenACC.
3. **Variable Modifiers**: The `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause ensures that each thread gets its own copy of these variables, similar to the private variables in OpenACC.
4. **Function Parameters**: The matrix `a`, `b`, and `c` are passed as double pointers for multi-dimensional arrays, emulating the Fortran syntax.
   
### Note:
- **Data Handling**: Ensure that memory for matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` is allocated and initialized appropriately before calling `gemm_parallel`.
- **Thread Safety**: OpenMP handles parallel execution with threads, making it suitable for shared-memory systems similar to OpenACC.
- **Performance Considerations**: For optimal performance, consider the nature of your hardware and adjust the number of threads or other OpenMP settings accordingly.

This OpenMP version should provide equivalent functionality and parallel performance to the original Fortran OpenACC code.

Output 7:
Below is a C/C++ version of the given Fortran OpenACC code for the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP for parallelization:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda,
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)`: This directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the combined loop over `j` and `i`, create private copies of variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` for each thread.
- We use `(i * lda + l)`, `(l * ldb + j)`, and `(i * ldc + j)` to access the elements of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. This follows the row-major order storage of C/C++ arrays (as opposed to column-major order in Fortran).
- The rest of the code implements the matrix multiplication and update operation similarly to the Fortran version. 

Make sure you compile this code with an OpenMP enabled compiler. For instance, with GCC you would use the `-fopenmp` flag.

Output 8:
Below is a version of the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation implemented in C/C++ using OpenMP for parallelism, which closely mirrors the functionality of the provided Fortran OpenACC code.

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    const int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double a[m * k] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
                       4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
                       7.0, 8.0, 9.0};

    double b[k * n] = {9.0, 8.0, 7.0,
                       6.0, 5.0, 4.0,
                       3.0, 2.0, 1.0};
                       
    double c[m * n] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                       0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
                       0.0, 0.0, 0.0};

    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, k, b, n, beta, c, n);

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            std::cout << c[i * n + j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **OpenMP Parallelism**: The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` directive allows the `j` and `i` loops to be parallelized, effectively distributing the outer two loops across multiple threads.
- **Matrix Indexing**: Fortran uses column-major order for matrices, while C/C++ uses row-major order. This means the index calculations `i + j*ldc` in Fortran translate to `i*ldc + j` in C/C++.
- **Private Variables**: In the OpenMP directive, variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are private by default due to their declaration inside the parallel block, ensuring thread safety.

Make sure to compile the code with OpenMP support, typically by using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC, e.g., `g++ -fopenmp gemm_parallel.cpp -o gemm_parallel`.

Output 9:
Below is a C/C++ version of the provided Fortran OpenACC code using OpenMP. This implements the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation. The corresponding `gemm_parallel` function is written in C/C++ with OpenMP pragmas to parallelize the loops:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(const int m, const int n, const int k, const double alpha, 
                   const double* a, const int lda, const double* b, const int ldb, 
                   const double beta, double* c, const int ldc) {

    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the outer loops using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Signature:**
  - The function `gemm_parallel` is defined to accept the matrix dimensions (`m`, `n`, `k`), scalar multipliers (`alpha`, `beta`), matrices (`a`, `b`, `c`), and their leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`).

- **Private Variables:**
  - Private variables in OpenMP ensure that each thread has its own instance of the variables.

- **Loop Parallelism:**
  - The looping structure is equivalent to the original Fortran code. The `pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` directive instructs the OpenMP runtime to parallelize the outer two loops (over `j` and `i`) and to collapse these into a single loop for scheduling. This allows for effective parallel execution.

- **Matrix Indexing:**
  - Matrix indexing in C/C++ takes into account zero-based indexing and layout where `a[i * lda + l]` and `b[l * ldb + j]` correctly reference elements of matrices `a` and `b`, respectively, and `c[i * ldc + j]` for matrix `c`.

To compile and run this code, ensure you include the OpenMP flag (generally `-fopenmp` for GCC):

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Feel free to integrate this function into your existing codebase or adjust it to match specific requirements of your setup.

Certainly! Below is a C/C++ version of your Fortran OpenACC GEMM subroutine implemented using OpenMP for parallelization. 

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the outer two loops with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature and Parameters**:
    - The function `gemm_parallel` performs the GEMM operation.
    - Parameters:
        - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
        - `alpha` and `beta`: Scalars used in the operation.
        - `a` and `b`: Input matrices.
        - `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`: Leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.
        - `c`: Resultant matrix (updated in place).

2. **Variables**:
    - `i`, `j`, `l`: Loop indices.
    - `temp`: Variable to accumulate the product sum.

3. **OpenMP Directive**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)`: This directive parallelizes the outer two loops (`j` and `i`), and each thread gets its private copy of the variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp`.

4. **Matrix Access**:
    - Array indexing in C starts from 0, so the loops run from `0` to `n-1` for `j`, from `0` to `m-1` for `i`, and from `0` to `k-1` for `l`.
    - Matrix elements are accessed using `i * lda + l` for matrix `a`, `l * ldb + j` for matrix `b`, and `i * ldc + j` for matrix `c`.

By using OpenMP for parallelization, the computation of the GEMM operation can be efficiently parallelized across multiple threads, similar to how OpenACC parallelizes the computation in Fortran.
