--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the C function implemented with OpenMP for the given subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i`, and the inner loop over `j` is executed by each OpenMP thread. This will distribute the workload among the available threads and accelerate the computation of the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is a C function implemented with OpenMP to compute the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation based on the given Fortran subroutine with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP. The computation of the SpMV operation remains the same as in the Fortran subroutine, where each thread computes a portion of the final `y` vector.

You can also adjust the number of threads using `omp_set_num_threads()` function before calling `spmv_parallel` function if needed.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the corresponding function implemented in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This function performs the same Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation as the given Fortran subroutine, but with OpenMP directives for parallelization in C.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is a C function implemented with OpenMP that performs the SpMV operation:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this function, the OpenMP directive `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop over the rows of the sparse matrix. This allows multiple threads to concurrently compute the SpMV operation on different rows of the matrix.

Note that the data sharing clauses (e.g., `shared`, `private`) are not explicitly specified in this example, so the compiler will determine the appropriate data-sharing for the variables based on the default behavior of OpenMP.

You can further optimize this function by adding appropriate data-sharing clauses and tuning the number of threads based on the architecture of your system.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop and perform a Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation similar to the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over the rows of the sparse matrix. This will distribute the computation of the SpMV operation across multiple threads using OpenMP.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Below is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP to parallelize the computation of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication operation. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop over the rows of the matrix, with each thread responsible for computing a subset of the rows. The `private(j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own local copy of the loop index `j`, while the `shared()` clause specifies the variables that are shared among all threads.

Note that the C function assumes row-major order for storing the sparse matrix and vector, similar to the Fortran implementation. You may need to adjust the data layout if your input data is stored differently.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the outer loop that iterates over the rows of the sparse matrix is parallelized using OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. The inner loop that computes the sparse matrix-vector multiplication is performed by each thread independently.

Note that the data is not explicitly copied in and out in the OpenMP version since OpenMP handles data scoping automatically.
