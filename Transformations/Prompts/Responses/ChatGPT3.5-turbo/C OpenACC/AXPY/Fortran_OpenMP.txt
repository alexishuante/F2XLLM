--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
``` 

In this implementation, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC, similar to the `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` directive in the Fortran code.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the AXPY operation (similar to the Fortran subroutine saxpy_parallel with OpenMP):

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop over the array elements using OpenACC. This will distribute the computations across the available parallel resources, similar to how the OpenMP directive `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` works in the Fortran subroutine saxpy_parallel.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
``` 

This C function uses OpenACC directives to parallelize the AXPY operation similar to the Fortran subroutine with OpenMP.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the AXPY operation (similar to the Fortran subroutine with OpenMP):

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang worker vector_length(128)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The loop will be executed in parallel on multiple gangs of workers, with a vector length of 128. This allows the AXPY operation to be performed efficiently on GPU devices that support OpenACC.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the C function with OpenACC that performs the same AXPY operation as the Fortran subroutine with OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x[0:n],y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    float a = 2.0;
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
    float y[] = {2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0};

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %.2f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this C code, the `saxpy_parallel` function uses OpenACC directives to parallelize the AXPY operation just like the Fortran subroutine `saxpy_parallel` with OpenMP. The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive instructs the compiler to parallelize the loop over the array elements.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The `present(x[0:n], y[0:n])` clause specifies that the data arrays `x` and `y` are present and accessible on the device.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y)
{
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC that performs the AXPY operation:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the AXPY operation is parallelized using OpenACC directives to take advantage of GPU acceleration.
