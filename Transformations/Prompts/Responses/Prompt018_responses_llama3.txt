Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that in the C version, I've assumed that the val, x, and y arrays are of type float, whereas in the Fortran version, they are of type real. If you need to use a different type (e.g., double), you can modify the C version accordingly.
Also, the #pragma acc kernels loop independent directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive specifies that the inner loop performs a reduction operation on the y[i] variable.
You can compile and run this code using an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc. For example:
$ pgcc -acc -o spmv spmv.c
$ ./spmv
This will execute the SpMV operation on the GPU (if available) or CPU.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator/Accelerator.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc kernels loop independent directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive performs a reduction on the y array.
To compile, use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc (Portland Group C Compiler) or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.
Example:
pgcc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c -laccl
Or
gcc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c -fopenacc -laccl
Run the program using the acc command:
acc spmv_parallel
This will execute the program on the GPU (if available) or CPU.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the loop indices are changed to start from 0, as C arrays are 0-indexed.
To compile, use a command like:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If your application uses float precision, you can simply replace double with float in the function signature and the #pragma acc directives.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify that the outer loop should be parallelized, and the #pragma acc loop directive to specify that the inner loop should be reduced to accumulate the partial results. The independent clause in the #pragma acc kernels directive indicates that the iterations of the outer loop can be executed independently, which is important for parallelization.
You can compile this function with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and link it with the appropriate libraries to use the OpenACC runtime.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made the following changes:
Changed the function signature to C style
Replaced real with double (since C's real is not a standard type)
Replaced intent(in/out) with copyin and copy directives to manage data transfer between host and device
Replaced private directive with reduction directive to perform reduction on y[i]
Changed loop indices to start from 0 (C style)
Also, please note that OpenACC is not as widely supported as OpenMP, and the code may not work on all platforms.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can change this to double if needed. Also, the copyin clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the necessary arrays are copied to the device, and the copy clause for y ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC with the libgomp plugin or the PGI compiler. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
Or:
pgcc -acc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y)
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to float in C. If you're using double precision, you should replace float with double in the C code.
Also, OpenACC's copyin clause is used to copy the arrays val, row, col, and x from the host to the device, and the copy clause is used to copy the array y from the host to the device and back to the host after the computation.
The reduction(+:y) clause is used to perform a reduction on the y array, which is necessary because multiple threads are updating the same elements of y simultaneously. This clause ensures that the updates are properly synchronized.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator/Accelerator.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y)
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause in the pragma directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are copied to the accelerator device, while the copy clause for y ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as the PGI compiler or the GNU compiler with the OpenACC extension.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can easily modify the code to use double if needed.
Also, the #pragma acc kernels loop independent directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop across the accelerator (GPU), and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive performs a reduction on the y[i] variable to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI suite, and run it on a GPU-enabled system.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
 #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that in OpenACC, the copyin clause is used to copy the arrays val, row, col, and x from the host to the device, and the copy clause is used to copy the array y from the device to the host after the computation is complete.
Also, the loop is parallelized using the parallel loop directive, and the loop directive is used to specify the loop that should be parallelized.
You can compile this code using a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the Portland Group, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.
For example:
pgcc -acc -o spmv spmv.c
./spmv
This will compile the code and run it on the default device. You can specify a specific device using the --device option, for example:
pgcc -acc --device=nvidia spmv.c
./spmv
This will compile the code and run it on an NVIDIA GPU.
