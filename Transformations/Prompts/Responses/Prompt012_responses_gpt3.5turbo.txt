Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

Output 2:
Here is a function implemented in C with OpenACC that corresponds to the Fortran subroutine gemv_parallel implemented with OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this function, the OpenACC directive `#pragma acc parallel loop` is used to parallelize the nested loops and perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation on the GPU. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses are used to specify the data movement between the CPU and GPU.

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this code, the `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)` directive is used to parallelize both loops in the GEMV operation using OpenACC. The `present(A, x, y)` clause ensures that the data arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are present in the device memory before the parallel region is executed.

Output 4:
Here is a function implemented in C and OpenACC that computes a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop (i loop) of the GEMV operation using OpenACC. The `present` clause is used to explicitly specify the data that needs to be present on the device before executing the parallel loop.

Note that in the Fortran subroutine provided, the index starts from 1, while in the C function, the index starts from 0 to match the C array indexing convention.

Output 5:
Here is a function implemented in C and OpenACC that performs a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) copyin(A[0:n][0:n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `gemv_parallel` function takes the size `n`, a 2D array `A`, input vector `x`, and output vector `y`. It uses a `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the computation of the GEMV operation using OpenACC. The `collapse(2)` clause is used to parallelize both nested loops efficiently.

This C function with OpenACC achieves parallelization similar to the Fortran subroutine `gemv_parallel` implemented with OpenMP, performing a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation.

Output 6:
Here is a C function with OpenACC directives implementing the gemv_parallel subroutine in Fortran with OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n]) private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n+j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop with the OpenACC programming model. The `present` clause ensures that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are available on the device. The `private(j, sum)` clause ensures that `j` and `sum` are private to each thread.

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y)
{
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenACC directives to offload the computation to GPU devices that support OpenACC. The `present` clause in the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive ensures that the specified arrays are present on the GPU device before executing the loop.

Output 8:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that replicates the functionality of the Fortran subroutine gemv_parallel:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y){
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++){
        sum = 0.0;
        for(j = 0; j < n; j++){
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the OpenACC directive `#pragma acc parallel loop` is used to parallelize the outer loop of the matrix-vector multiplication operation. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses are included to explicitly specify the data movement between the host and device memory. Make sure to compile this code with a compliant compiler that supports OpenACC directives.

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC implementation:
```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n+j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `collapse(2)` directive in OpenACC is used to parallelize both nested loops (i and j) of the GEMV operation. This will distribute the work across multiple threads and execute it in parallel on GPU devices supporting OpenACC.

Output 10:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenACC that computes the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[:n*n], x[:n], y[:n]) private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop that calculates the GEMV operation. The `present` clause is used to specify that the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are present on the device. The `private` clause is used to declare private variables `j` and `sum` within each thread.

Note that the array indexing in the C implementation is different from the Fortran implementation due to the row-major order used in C as compared to column-major order in Fortran.
