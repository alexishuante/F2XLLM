Output 1:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the AXPY operation:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the AXPY operation using OpenACC. The `present(x[0:n], y[0:n])` clause is used to specify that the `x` and `y` arrays are present on the device.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC, similar to how it was done in Fortran with OpenMP.

Output 3:
Here is the function implemented in C and OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C code, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC, similar to the `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` directive used in the Fortran code with OpenMP.

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent AXPY operation implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float x[], float y[]) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we use `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive in the loop to parallelize the computation of the AXPY operation using OpenACC.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y){
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

Output 6:
Here is an equivalent function implemented in C and OpenACC for the given subroutine in Fortran and OpenMP:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels loop present(x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `#pragma acc kernels loop present(x, y)` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. The `present(x, y)` clause specifies that the `x` and `y` arrays are present on the device and can be used in the parallel computation.

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenACC that performs the AXPY operation (y = a*x + y):

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y)
{
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this function, we use `#pragma acc parallel loop` to parallelize the loop using OpenACC. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across the available resources to accelerate the computation.

Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenACC:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this function, the AXPY operation is performed in parallel using OpenACC directives. The `pragma acc parallel loop` directive parallelizes the loop iteration across multiple threads, similar to how the OpenMP directive `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` does in the Fortran subroutine.

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenACC for the saxpy_parallel subroutine implemented in Fortran and OpenMP:

```c
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC directives. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads on the GPU for parallel execution.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent AXPY operation implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float x[], float y[]) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this code, the AXPY operation is parallelized using OpenACC pragma directive `#pragma acc parallel loop`.
