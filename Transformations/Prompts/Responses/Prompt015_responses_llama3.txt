Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to explicitly specify the array indices, whereas in Fortran, the indices are implicit. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenACC directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to explicitly calculate the indices in the array. Also, the reduction clause is used to parallelize the inner loop, which performs the dot product of the rows of a and columns of b.
To compile this code, you would need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc from the Portland Group or gcc with the OpenACC plugin. You would also need to link against a BLAS library, such as OpenBLAS, to get the optimized matrix multiplication routines.
Here is the command to compile and link the code:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c -lblas
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the arrays. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to tell the compiler that this function should be compiled in sequential mode, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive is used to parallelize the loop.
Also, you can use OpenACC's present clause to specify that the arrays a, b, and c are already present on the device, which can improve performance:
#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(a, b, c)
You can also use OpenACC's tile clause to specify the tile size for the parallel loop:
#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) tile(i, j, 16) present(a, b, c)
This will divide the iteration space into 16x16 tiles, which can improve performance on some devices.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the reduction clause is used to specify that the variable temp is a reduction variable, and the + operator is used to specify that the reduction operation is summation.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding

interface
  subroutine gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(C_INT), value :: m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc
    real(C_DOUBLE), value :: alpha, beta
    real(C_DOUBLE) :: a(lda, k), b(ldb, n)
    real(C_DOUBLE) :: c(ldc, n)
  end subroutine gemm_parallel
end interface

program main
  integer :: m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc
  real(kind=8) :: alpha, beta
  real(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:,:), b(:,:), c(:,:)

  ! Allocate arrays and initialize data...

  call gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc)

end program main
This way, you can call the C function from your Fortran code and take advantage of the OpenACC parallelization.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to manually compute the indices for the 2D arrays a and b since C stores multidimensional arrays in row-major order. Also, the reduction clause is added to the innermost loop to ensure that the summation is performed correctly in parallel.
Please note that the array indices in the C code are 0-based, whereas they are 1-based in the Fortran code.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to compute the correct indexing. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that this function can be called from an OpenACC parallel region.
To use this function with OpenACC, you would need to create a parallel region outside of this function, like this:
#pragma acc parallel
{
  gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
}
This would offload the computation to the accelerator device.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenACC directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can be parallelized.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run on a GPU or other accelerator.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as GCC or PGI, with the -acc flag. For example:
gcc -acc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate a parallel version of the GEMM routine that can be executed on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to adjust the indexing accordingly. Also, the ollapse(2) clause in the OpenACC directive tells the compiler to collapse the two inner loops into one, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
  int m = 100, n = 100, k = 100;
  double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
  double *a = (double *)malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
  double *b = (double *)malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
  double *c = (double *)malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

  // Initialize a, b, and c

  #pragma acc data copy(a[:m*k], b[:k*n], c[:m*n])
  {
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);
  }

  // Deallocate memory

  return 0;
}
This code allocates memory for the matrices a, b, and c, initializes them (not shown), and then calls the gemm_parallel function. The #pragma acc data directive tells the compiler to copy the data to the GPU, and the copy clause specifies which arrays to copy.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can be parallelized by the OpenACC compiler.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device that supports OpenACC.
