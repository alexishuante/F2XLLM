Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine using OpenACC:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, we use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop over `i`, similar to the `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP` directive in the Fortran subroutine. The inner loop for `j` is not explicitly parallelized in this C function, assuming that the compiler will optimize it appropriately.

Note that additional modifications may be needed depending on the specific requirements of your program and the system you are working on.

Output 2:
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for shared(val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Output 3:
Here is a C function implemented using OpenMP that performs the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This function takes as input the size of the matrix (n), the number of non-zero elements (nnz), arrays for values (val), row indices (row), column indices (col), input vector (x), and output vector (y). It then performs the SpMV operation in parallel using OpenMP directives.

Please note that this code assumes that the parallel region is properly initialized elsewhere in your program.

Output 4:
Here is a C function implemented using OpenMP that performs the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the outer loop over the rows of the sparse matrix to compute the matrix-vector product. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to distribute the iterations of the outer loop among the available threads in the parallel region.

Please note that in the Fortran subroutine provided, the row and col arrays are 1-based, while in C they are 0-based, so adjustments have been made accordingly in the C function. Also, the OpenMP `#pragma omp parallel for` directive achieves the parallelization equivalent to the OpenACC `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP` directive used in the Fortran subroutine.

Output 5:
Here is the C function implemented in OpenMP that computes the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double val[], int row[], int col[], double x[], double y[]) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, we used OpenMP directives to parallelize the outer loop of the SpMV operation. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive applies parallelism to the loop, with each thread working on a different iteration of the loop. The private clause ensures that each thread has its own private variables `i` and `j`. The shared clause specifies that all threads will share the variables `n`, `nnz`, `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y`.

This C function is equivalent to the provided Fortran subroutine implemented with OpenACC for SpMV operation.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the OpenACC implementation in Fortran. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive instructs the compiler to distribute the iterations of the outer loop across multiple threads for parallel execution.

Please note that the C implementation assumes that the matrices and vectors are stored in row-major order, similar to the Fortran implementation. The code may need to be adapted if the storage order is different.

Output 7:
```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP to parallelize the computation of the SpMV operation. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to distribute the iterations of the outer loop across multiple threads. This allows the computation to be done in parallel, improving performance on multicore processors.

Output 9:
Here is the corresponding function in C and OpenMP:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, the OpenMP directive `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i`. The loop is divided among the available threads, with each thread computing a subset of the iterations. The `shared` and `private` clauses are used to specify the data sharing and private variables within the parallel region.

This C function performs the same Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation as the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC.

Output 10:
Here is the corresponding function in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP for multi-threading.

Both the Fortran subroutine and the C function perform the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using the same algorithm, but the code is written in different languages and parallelized using different parallel computing frameworks (OpenACC for Fortran and OpenMP for C).
