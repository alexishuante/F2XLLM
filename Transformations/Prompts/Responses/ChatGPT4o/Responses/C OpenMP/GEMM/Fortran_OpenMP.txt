--------------- Output 1 ---------------
To convert the provided Fortran subroutine `gemm_parallel` into a C function using OpenMP, we'll follow a similar structure. The main differences to pay attention to will be proper indexing, as C arrays are zero-based whereas Fortran arrays are one-based, and ensuring we appropriately handle multi-dimensional arrays.

Here's the equivalent GEMM implementation in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, 
                   int n, 
                   int k, 
                   double alpha, 
                   const double *a, 
                   int lda, 
                   const double *b, 
                   int ldb, 
                   double beta, 
                   double *c, 
                   int ldc) 
{
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of the gemm_parallel function
    
    int m = 2, n = 2, k = 2;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    
    double a[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}; // 2x2 row-major matrix
    int lda = 2;
    
    double b[4] = {5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0}; // 2x2 row-major matrix
    int ldb = 2;
    
    double c[4] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // 2x2 row-major matrix
    int ldc = 2;
    
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The parameters of the `gemm_parallel` function match those in the Fortran subroutine.
    - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
    - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars.
    - `a`, `b`, `c`: Matrix data (flattened into 1D arrays to simulate 2D arrays).
    - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices.

2. **Indexing**: 
    - In C, matrices are accessed in a row-major order. Thus, we calculate the index in the 1D array using `i * lda + l` for matrix `a`, `l * ldb + j` for matrix `b`, and `i * ldc + j` for matrix `c`.

3. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outermost loop (`j` loop). Variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are private to each thread.
    - `schedule(static)` ensures each thread gets a chunk of iterations to execute, often used for load balancing.

4. **Example Usage in `main`**:
    - An example demonstrating how to initialize matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, and call the `gemm_parallel` function.
    - After the function call, the resulting matrix `c` is printed.

This function performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation in a parallel manner using OpenMP.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Certainly! Below is the equivalent function in C, utilizing OpenMP to perform the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation. This function assumes that matrices are passed in row-major order, which is typical for C (unlike Fortran's column-major order).

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    // Parallelized loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Signature**: The function `gemm_parallel` takes matrix dimensions `m, n, k`, scalar multipliers `alpha, beta`, and pointers to matrices `a, b, c` together with their respective leading dimensions `lda, ldb, ldc`.

   - `m`: Number of rows in matrices `a` and `c`
   - `n`: Number of columns in matrices `b` and `c`
   - `k`: Number of columns in matrix `a` and number of rows in matrix `b`
   - `alpha`: Scalar multiplier applied to the multiplication of `a` and `b`
   - `beta`: Scalar multiplier applied to matrix `c` before adding the result of `a` and `b` multiplication
   - `a`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `a`
   - `lda`: Leading dimension of matrix `a`
   - `b`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `b`
   - `ldb`: Leading dimension of matrix `b`
   - `c`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `c`
   - `ldc`: Leading dimension of matrix `c`

2. **OpenMP Parallelization**: The pragma `#pragma omp parallel for` parallelizes the outer loop iterating over `j` (the columns of the resulting matrix `c`). The `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause ensures that each thread operates on its own copy of these variables. The `schedule(static)` clause statically divides the loop iterations among threads.

3. **Matrix Multiplication Logic**: The inner loops:
   - Iterate over `i` (rows of matrices `a` and `c`)
   - Calculate `temp` by summing up the product of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` for each `l`
   - Update `c` at `(i, j)` using the formula `c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j]`

4. **Indexing in C**: The elements of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are accessed using row-major order, adhering to C's typical layout for multidimensional arrays:

   - `a[i * lda + l]`: Element in the `i`th row and `l`th column of `a`
   - `b[l * ldb + j]`: Element in the `l`th row and `j`th column of `b`
   - `c[i * ldc + j]`: Element in the `i`th row and `j`th column of `c`

Make sure that OpenMP is enabled when compiling this code. For example, you can compile with GCC using the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
```

This will ensure that the parallelization directives are recognized and properly utilized by the compiler.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
You can implement the subroutine `gemm_parallel` in C with OpenMP as follows. Here's the equivalent C function:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Declaring Variables and Including OpenMP:**
   - Include the OpenMP header with `#include <omp.h>`.
   - Declare variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` similarly to the Fortran subroutine.

2. **OpenMP Parallel Directive:**
   - Use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop (over `j`) and declare the variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` as private.

3. **Nested Loops:**
   - The outer loop iterates over the columns `j`.
   - The middle loop iterates over the rows `i`.
   - Inside these loops, we initialize `temp` to 0.0.
   - The inner loop iterates over `l` to compute the dot product `temp` of row `i` from matrix `a` and column `j` from matrix `b`.

4. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - After computing `temp`, update the value of `c[i * ldc + j]` using the formula `alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j]`.

### Explanation of Matrix Indexing:

In Fortran, arrays are typically column-major order, whereas in C, arrays are row-major. To access the element at row `i` and column `j`:
- For matrix `a`, the memory offset is `i * lda + l`.
- For matrix `b`, the memory offset is `l * ldb + j`.
- For matrix `c`, the memory offset is `i * ldc + j`.

Additionally, the loops start from `0` in C, while in Fortran they start from `1`.

### Usage Example:

You can call this function in your C code as follows:

```c
int main() {
    // Define matrix sizes
    int m = 4, n = 3, k = 5;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.5;

    // Allocate matrices (assuming C style row-major order)
    double a[4][5] = {/* initialize as needed */};
    double b[5][3] = {/* initialize as needed */};
    double c[4][3] = {/* initialize as needed */};

    // Calling the function
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, &a[0][0], 5, &b[0][0], 3, beta, &c[0][0], 3);

    return 0;
}
```

This function should be compiled with an OpenMP-aware compiler (e.g., `gcc` with the `-fopenmp` flag).

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function that performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenMP for parallelization. This function corresponds to the Fortran subroutine you've provided.

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, 
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of the gemm_parallel function
    int m = 2, n = 3, k = 2;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    double b[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    double c[] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // m * n

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, k, b, n, beta, c, n);

    // Print the result matrix C
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * n + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature and Parameters:**
   - The function `gemm_parallel` accepts the following parameters:
     - `m, n, k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
     - `alpha, beta`: Scalars used in computation.
     - `a, b`: Pointer to the first elements of matrices `a` and `b`.
     - `lda, ldb, ldc`: Leading dimensions of matrices `a, b, c` respectively.
     - `c`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `c`.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization:**
   - The outer loop over `j` is parallelized with `#pragma omp parallel for` directive.
   - The `private` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of `i, j, l, temp`.

3. **Matrix Access:**
   - For accessing matrix elements, row-major order is assumed:
     - `a[i * lda + l]` accesses element (i, l) in matrix `a`.
     - `b[l * ldb + j]` accesses element (l, j) in matrix `b`.
     - `c[i * ldc + j]` accesses element (i, j) in matrix `c`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - An example usage of `gemm_parallel` demonstrates how to initialize matrices and call the function.
   - It also prints the resulting matrix `c`.

### Notes:
1. The array indexing in C starts from 0, hence the loops run from 0 to size-1.
2. The matrix dimensions are given in a linear format, i.e., all elements of a matrix are stored in a single array in row-major order.
3. The variable `temp` is used for temporary storage of the computation inside the innermost loop.

This code can be directly compiled using a C compiler with OpenMP support (e.g., `gcc -fopenmp filename.c -o output`).

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Certainly! Here is the equivalent C function implementing the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP. The function signature follows common C conventions:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. The function arguments:
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalar values used in the GEMM operation.
   - `a`: Pointer to the matrix `a` of dimensions `lda x k`.
   - `lda`: Leading dimension of matrix `a`.
   - `b`: Pointer to the matrix `b` of dimensions `ldb x n`.
   - `ldb`: Leading dimension of matrix `b`.
   - `c`: Pointer to the matrix `c` of dimensions `ldc x n`.
   - `ldc`: Leading dimension of matrix `c`.

2. The outermost loop iterates over the columns of matrix `b` and `c` (`j` loop).

3. The middle loop iterates over the rows of matrix `a` and `c` (`i` loop).

4. The innermost loop computes the dot product for each element in matrix `c` (`l` loop).

5. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outermost loop (`j` loop) and uses the static scheduling type.

6. Private variables in the OpenMP directive ensure thread safety (each thread has its own copy of `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp`).

By adhering to C conventions and using OpenMP for parallelism, this function effectively mirrors the functionality of the provided Fortran subroutine.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Certainly! Below is a C implementation of the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation utilizing OpenMP for parallel processing. The structure and logic are analogous to the provided Fortran code.

```c

    double b[4] = {5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0}; // 2x2 matrix
    double c[4] = {9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0}; // 2x2 matrix

    int lda = 2, ldb = 2, ldc = 2;

```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - `gemm_parallel`: The function performs the GEMM operation.
   - Parameters:
     - `int m, n, k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
     - `double alpha, beta`: Scalars used in the linear combination.
     - `double *a, *b, *c`: Pointers to the matrices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
     - `int lda, ldb, ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).

2. **OpenMP Directive**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive indicates that the loop iterations should be executed in parallel.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)`: Indicates that each thread should have its own private copies of these variables.
   - `schedule(static)`: The `static` scheduling clause distributes iterations of the loop in equal-sized blocks to threads.

3. **Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over columns of \(C\).
   - The middle loop iterates over rows of \(C\).
   - The innermost loop performs the dot product for the corresponding row of \(A\) and column of \(B\).

4. **Matrix Indexing**:
   - Matrices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are stored in column-major order, which matches Fortran’s default array storage.

5. **Main Function**:
   - Provides an example usage of the `gemm_parallel` function and prints the resulting matrix \(C\).

### Notes:
- Ensure that OpenMP is enabled when compiling the code. For example, you can use the `-fopenmp` flag with `gcc`:
  ```sh
  gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
  ```
- This example demonstrates a simple `2x2` matrix multiplication to verify the implementation. The provided matrices and scalars can be adjusted to test different scenarios.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function using OpenMP to compute the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation given the provided Fortran subroutine definition:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Variables and Parameters**:
  - `m`, `n`, `k`, `alpha`, `beta` are directly taken from Fortran code.
  - `a`, `b`, `c` here are pointers representing the matrices `a`, `b`, `c` in Fortran.
  - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc` are the leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, `c` respectively.

- **OpenMP Directives**:
  - `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outermost loop over `j`.
  - `private(i, j, l, temp)` ensures that each thread has its own private copies of these loop variables and the temporary accumulator `temp`.
  - `schedule(static)` ensures that iterations are divided into contiguous chunks for each thread.

### Notes:
1. **Array Access**:
   - Fortran arrays are column-major order while C arrays are row-major; hence, the access pattern matches Fortran by manually calculating the addressing for the multidimensional arrays using the provided leading dimensions.
   - Access pattern: `a[i * lda + l]` in C matches `a(i, l)` in Fortran because `a` is column-major in Fortran.
   - Likewise for `b[l * ldb + j]` and `c[i * ldc + j]`.

2. **Loop Indices**:
   - Fortran arrays are 1-based whereas C arrays are 0-based. Thus, loops in C start from 0 and go to less than the upper bound.

### Usage:
To use this function, you must link your program with OpenMP support (often using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC):

```sh
gcc -fopenmp your_program.c -o your_program
```

And invoke the `gemm_parallel` function with appropriate arguments in your C code.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function using OpenMP to implement the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

Make sure you have the OpenMP header included and be aware that matrix indices in C are zero-based while they are one-based in Fortran, so some adjustments are necessary in the indexing.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive distributes the iterations of the outermost loop among different threads.
- The `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of these loop indices and the `temp` variable.
- The matrix access in C is done using zero-based indexing, so appropriate adjustments are made in the access patterns (`i * lda + l` for accessing `a`, etc.).
- The `schedule(static)` clause is used in the same way as in the Fortran code to statically distribute the iterations of the loop to the threads.

To compile this with OpenMP support, use the `-fopenmp` flag for GCC or the appropriate flag for your compiler:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This function should closely follow the behavior and parallelism of your provided Fortran subroutine.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Certainly! Here's an equivalent function in C using OpenMP for the generalized matrix multiplication operation described in your Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda,
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
            }
            c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive starts a parallel region and distributes the loop iterations among the available threads.
- `private(i, j, l, temp)`: This clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of these variables.
- `schedule(static)`: This clause specifies that loop iterations are divided into contiguous chunks of approximately equal size, and each thread is assigned a chunk.

### Parameters:
- `m`: Number of rows of matrices A and C.
- `n`: Number of columns of matrices B and C.
- `k`: Number of columns of matrix A and rows of matrix B.
- `alpha`: Scalar multiplier for the matrix multiplication result.
- `a`: Pointer to the first element of matrix A with dimensions `lda` by `k`.
- `lda`: Leading dimension of matrix A.
- `b`: Pointer to the first element of matrix B with dimensions `ldb` by `n`.
- `ldb`: Leading dimension of matrix B.
- `beta`: Scalar multiplier for matrix C.
- `c`: Pointer to the first element of matrix C with dimensions `ldc` by `n`.
- `ldc`: Leading dimension of matrix C.

Ensure you include the OpenMP library during compilation, for example:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
```

This will enable the use of OpenMP for parallelization in the compiled executable.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Certainly! Below is the C implementation of the provided Fortran subroutine for Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenMP for parallelization. Note that in C, arrays are typically accessed in row-major order, but we'll maintain the column-major order to match typical Fortran array behavior.

Here's the corresponding C code:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k,
                   double alpha, const double *a, int lda,
                   const double *b, int ldb,
                   double beta, double *c, int ldc) {

    #pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
            }
            c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   The function `gemm_parallel` takes in the matrix dimensions `m`, `n`, and `k`, the scalars `alpha` and `beta`, and the matrix pointers `a`, `b`, and `c` with their leading dimensions `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`.

2. **Parallelization**:
   We use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop over `j` with a static schedule and the loop is parallelized with private variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp`.

3. **Matrix Access**:
   Since Fortran arrays are stored in column-major order, which means that the elements of each column are stored in contiguous memory locations, we maintain this order by indexing as `a[i + l * lda]` and `b[l + j * ldb]`.

4. **Computation**:
   A temporary variable `temp` is used to accumulate the inner product of row `i` of matrix `a` and column `j` of matrix `b`. Finally, this accumulated value is scaled by `alpha` and added to `beta * c[i + j * ldc]`.

### Compilation:
To compile this code with OpenMP support, you need to use an OpenMP-compatible compiler and enable OpenMP during compilation. For example, with GCC:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Make sure to link the OpenMP library properly if you're using a different compiler, such as ICC or Clang.

This should provide the equivalent parallel GEMM operation as outlined in the Fortran subroutine you provided.
