Sure, here's the equivalent function in C using OpenMP for a generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV). This function performs the same operation as the provided Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;

    // Example input
    float A[3][3] = {
        {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
        {4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
        {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}
    };
    float x[3] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
    float y[3];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Output the resulting vector y
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Make sure you compile the code with the OpenMP flag, for example:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c
```

Explanation of the code:
- The `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum)` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP.
- The `private(i, j, sum)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the loop variables `i`, `j`, and `sum`.
- The main function initializes an example `3x3` matrix `A` and a vector `x` of size 3.
- The `gemv_parallel` function is called to compute the matrix-vector product, storing the result in the vector `y`.
- Finally, the resulting vector `y` is printed.

This should provide you with the parallel GEMV operation using OpenMP in C, just as it was implemented in your Fortran subroutine.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float* A, const float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this implementation:

- The matrix \( A \) is passed as a one-dimensional array, assuming row-major order (which is the default in C).
- The vectors \( x \) and \( y \) are passed as one-dimensional arrays.
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop over `i`, and the `private(j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the loop variable `j`.

Make sure to compile your code with the `-fopenmp` flag to enable OpenMP, for example:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o my_program my_program.c
```

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Certainly! Below is an equivalent C function that performs a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation using OpenMP for parallelization.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: 
   - The function `gemv_parallel` receives parameters for the dimensions (int `n`), the matrix (float `A[n][n]`), the input vector (float `x[n]`), and the output vector (float `y[n]`).
   
2. **OpenMP Parallel Directive**: 
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop (`for (i = 0; i < n; i++)`). This distributes the iterations of the loop across multiple threads.

3. **Private and Shared Clauses**: 
   - The `private(j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the variable `j`.
   - The `shared(A, x, y)` clause indicates that the matrix `A` and the vectors `x` and `y` are shared among all threads.

4. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:
   - For each iteration of the outer loop (each row `i` of matrix `A`), the inner loop computes the dot product of the `i-th` row of `A` with the vector `x`, storing the result in `sum`.
   - The result `sum` is then stored in the `i-th` entry of the output vector `y`.

### Note:

- Make sure to compile the program with OpenMP support enabled, typically using the `-fopenmp` flag for GCC:
  ```sh
  gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
  ```
- In the above C code, the matrix `A` and vector `x` must be pre-initialized with appropriate values before calling `gemv_parallel`. Similarly, the output vector `y` must be allocated with appropriate size.
- The OpenMP library must be linked during compilation, which is enabled by the `-fopenmp` flag. Ensure OpenMP is available in your C compiler and system.

With these changes, the `gemv_parallel` function should perform similarly to the provided Fortran subroutine with OpenMP for parallel execution.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here's an equivalent C function implemented with OpenMP for the Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation described in your Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j) schedule(static)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Matrix Representation:**
   - In Fortran, matrices are stored in column-major order by default, while in C, matrices are stored in row-major order. However, this doesn't affect the implementation of the algorithm itself; we just need to ensure proper indexing.

2. **OpenMP Directives:**
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive creates a parallel region and divides the loop iterations among threads.
   - `private(j)` ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the loop variable `j`.
   - `schedule(static)` simply means that the iterations are divided into contiguous chunks and statically assigned to threads. This is used as an example, and you could customize the scheduling as per your needs.

### Notes:

1. **Data Types:**
   - The Fortran `real` data type corresponds to `float` in C. You could use `double` instead if you require double precision.
   
2. **Matrix Storage:**
   - The matrix `A` is passed as a pointer to pointers (`float **A`), which is a common way to represent 2D arrays in C. Make sure the memory for `A` is properly allocated before passing it to the function.

### Example of Usage:

To call the `gemv_parallel` function, ensure that you properly allocate and initialize the matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y`, as shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function prototype
void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y);

int main() {
    int n = 4; // Example size
    
    // Allocate memory for matrix A and vectors x and y
    float **A = (float **)malloc(n * sizeof(float *));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    }
    
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    
    // Initialize matrix A and vector x (example values)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            A[i][j] = i + j; // example initialization
        }
        x[i] = i; // example initialization
    }
    
    // Call the matrix-vector multiplication function
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    
    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
```
This code initializes a matrix `A` and a vector `x`, performs the GEMV operation in parallel, and prints the result.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Certainly! The following is a C implementation of the given Fortran subroutine with OpenMP. This function computes the generalized matrix-vector multiplication \( y = A \cdot x \) for a square matrix \( A \) of size \( n \times n \) and vectors \( x \) and \( y \) of length \( n \).

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)

        double sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;  // Example size of the matrix
    double A[16] = {1, 2, 3, 4,
                    5, 6, 7, 8,
                    9, 10, 11, 12,
                    13, 14, 15, 16};  // Example square matrix (4x4)
    double x[4] = {1, 1, 1, 1};  // Example vector
    double y[4];  // Result vector

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature and Variables:**
   - The function `gemv_parallel` takes an integer `n` (the dimension of the matrix and vectors), a pointer to the matrix `A` (assumed to be stored in row-major order), a pointer to the input vector `x`, and a pointer to the output vector `y`.

2. **Parallelization:**
   - The outer loop is parallelized with OpenMP using `#pragma omp parallel for`. Each thread gets a private copy of `i` and `j`, as well as `sum`, to avoid race conditions.

3. **Matrix-Vector Computation:**
   - For each row `i` of the matrix `A`, compute the dot product of the `i`-th row of `A` with the vector `x`, and store the result in `y[i]`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Contains an example to demonstrate the use of `gemv_parallel` with a simple \(4 \times 4\) matrix and a vector.

### Compiling and Running:
You need a compiler that supports OpenMP (e.g., GCC). Compile and run the code as follows:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
./gemv_parallel
```

This will output the result of the matrix-vector multiplication. The example uses a \(4 \times 4\) matrix where each element is 1 for simplicity, making it easy to verify the correctness. You can modify `A` and `x` to test other cases.

Feel free to customize and optimize further based on specific needs or hardware capabilities!

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Sure! Below is the C implementation of the Fortran subroutine `gemv_parallel` using OpenMP for parallel computation. This function performs the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV)
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

// Example main program to test the function
int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[3][3] = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}};
    float x[3] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    float y[3];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the C implementation:
1. **Function signature**: `void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n])` defines the function which performs the GEMV operation.
2. **OpenMP pragma**: `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)` is used to parallelize the outer loop over the rows of the matrix `A`. The variables `i` and `j` are made private to each thread, while `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.
3. **Loops**: The nested loops over `i` and `j` perform the matrix-vector multiplication. The inner loop computes the dot product of the `i`-th row of `A` and the vector `x`, and stores the result in `y[i]`.

This C program includes a `main` function that demonstrates how to call `gemv_parallel` and prints the resulting vector `y`. Note that when running parallelized code using OpenMP, you may need to compile with the `-fopenmp` flag, for example using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp your_program.c -o your_program
./your_program
```

This ensures that the OpenMP directives are properly recognized and utilized by the compiler.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Sure! Below is a C function using OpenMP that implements the same Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) as the Fortran subroutine you've provided.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    // Parallelize the outer loop
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Header**: We include `omp.h` to use OpenMP.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `gemv_parallel` takes an integer `n` (matrix/vector size), a 2D array `A` of dimensions `n` x `n`, and two vectors `x` and `y`, both of length `n`.
3. **Parallel Directive**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive parallelizes the `for` loop that iterates over the rows of matrix `A`.
   - `private(j, sum)`: The variables `j` and `sum` are private to each thread, meaning each thread gets its own copy.
   - `shared(A, x, y)`: The arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads. They are not modified by individual threads, or when they are, it is in a manner that does not lead to race conditions (i.e., each thread modifies a different part of `y`).
4. **Loop Construction**: The outer loop iterates over each row of the matrix. For each row, an inner loop multiplies the elements of the row by the corresponding elements of the vector `x` and accumulates the result in `sum`. This sum is then stored in the corresponding entry of vector `y`.

Make sure to compile this C code with appropriate flags to enable OpenMP, usually `-fopenmp` for GCC:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

This implementation should provide parallelized execution of the matrix-vector multiplication, leveraging multiple CPU cores much as the Fortran OpenMP implementation does.

                    13, 14, 15, 16};

        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matrix and Vector Declaration**: 
    - The matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y` are defined as one-dimensional arrays. The matrix `A` is stored in a row-major order.
2. **OpenMP Directive**: 
    - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. `private(j, sum)` ensures that each thread has its private copies of `j` and `sum`.
3. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: 
    - The nested loops perform the generalized matrix-vector multiplication. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop handles the dot product between the row of `A` and the vector `x`.
4. **Flattened Matrix Access**: 
    - Access to the elements of the 2D matrix `A` in the 1D array is achieved using the formula `A[i*n + j]`.

This conversion should function similarly to the provided Fortran subroutine. The `main` function demonstrates a simple test matrix and vector and prints the resultant vector after the GEMV operation. In a real application, the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` would be dynamically managed and passed to `gemv_parallel` function as needed.

    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Declaration**: The function `gemv_parallel` takes four arguments:
   - `n`: The size of the matrix and vectors.
   - `A`: Pointer to a flattened 2D matrix of size `n x n`.
   - `x`: Pointer to an input vector of size `n`.
   - `y`: Pointer to an output vector of size `n`.

2. **OpenMP**: The `#pragma omp parallel for private(j)` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The loop variable `j` is marked as private to ensure each thread has its own instance of `j`.

3. **Matrix Access**: The matrix `A` is accessed using a flattened indexing method (`A[i * n + j]`), as C stores multi-dimensional arrays in row-major order.

4. **Computation**: Inside the parallel loop, the sum is accumulated for each row `i` of the matrix `A` multiplied by the vector `x` and assigned to the corresponding element `y[i]`.

5. **Main Function**: The `main` function initializes a 4x4 matrix `A`, a vector `x`, and calls `gemv_parallel`. It then prints out the result stored in vector `y`.

The above code demonstrates a simple yet efficient way to perform matrix-vector multiplication in parallel using OpenMP in C. Make sure to compile the code with OpenMP support, typically using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC.

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:**
    - `void gemv_parallel(int n, float** A, float* x, float* y)`: This function performs GEMV operation (`y = Ax`) in parallel using OpenMP, where `n` is the size of the square matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y`.
    - `A` is a pointer to a dynamically allocated 2D array (matrix).
    - `x` and `y` are pointers to arrays (vectors).

2. **OpenMP Parallelism:**
    - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, distributing iterations over multiple threads.
    - `private(i, j, sum)` declares `i`, `j`, and `sum` as private to each thread.
    - `shared(A, x, y)` declares `A`, `x`, and `y` as shared among all threads.

3. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication:**
    - In each thread, for row `i`, the sum of element-wise multiplications of row `i` of matrix `A` and vector `x` is calculated and stored in `y[i]`.

4. **Main Function:**
    - An example of how to call the `gemv_parallel` function is shown.
    - `A` is dynamically allocated.
    - Input values for matrix `A` and vector `x` are specified.
    - The result is printed.
    - Memory for `A` is freed at the end.

### Notes:
- Remember to compile the code with OpenMP support using the `-fopenmp` flag if you are using `gcc`. For example:
  ```sh
  gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
  ```
- This example assumes `float** A` for a dynamically allocated 2D array. Adjust memory allocation and deallocation if you use `float A[n][n]` or other memory management strategies.
