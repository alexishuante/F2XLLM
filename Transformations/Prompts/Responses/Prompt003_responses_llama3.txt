Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for parallelization:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, and the intent keywords are not used. Instead, the function parameters are explicitly declared as int or double *.
The OpenMP parallelization is achieved using the #pragma omp parallel for directive, which parallelizes the outer loop. The private clause is used to declare the variables j and sum as private to each thread.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, like this:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will create an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run to test the function.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to arrays (double **A and double *x and double *y) instead of the 2D array A(n,n) and vectors x(n) and y(n) used in Fortran. Also, the index range is 0-based in C, so the loop starts from 0 instead of 1.
Also, I assumed that the real type in Fortran is equivalent to double in C. If you want to use float instead, just replace all the double occurrences with float.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will create an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run.
You can also add some optimizations to the code, like using firstprivate to initialize the sum variable only once per thread, and reduction to avoid race conditions when updating the y array:
#pragma omp parallel for private(j) firstprivate(sum) reduction(+:y[:n])
This will create a separate sum variable for each thread, initialize it to 0 only once per thread, and use a reduction operation to combine the partial results into the final y array.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  double sum;

  #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the private clause in OpenMP is used to specify that each thread should have its own copy of the variables j and sum.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
  int n = 1000;
  double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
  double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
  double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

  // Initialize A and x

  gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

  free(A);
  free(x);
  free(y);

  return 0;
}
This code assumes that you have already initialized the matrices A and x. The gemv_parallel function will compute the matrix-vector product and store the result in the array y.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, and the intent statements are not needed either, as the variables are passed by reference ( pointers ) .
Also, the loop indices in C start from 0, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can call this function by passing the address of the first element of the arrays A, x, and y, and the dimension n as:
double A[n * n];
double x[n];
double y[n];

// Initialize A and x

gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
This code will compute the matrix-vector product in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, whereas in Fortran they start from 1 by default.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP support, e.g. gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
To compile the C code, you can use:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will create an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run.
You can also use the -O3 flag for optimization:
gcc -fopenmp -O3 gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate optimized code that runs faster.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can call this function by passing the address of the first element of the arrays A, x, and y, and the dimension n as arguments.
Example:
int main() {
    int n = 10;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    // Initialize A and x
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);
    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP support, e.g. using gcc with the -fopenmp flag.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing calculations. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed.
You can call this function with the same arguments as the Fortran subroutine: n, A, x, and y.
