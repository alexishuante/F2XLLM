--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the index starts from 0 in C, so we adjust the loop bounds accordingly.
Also, note that the double **A declaration assumes that the 2D array A is passed as an array of pointers to rows, which is the typical way of passing 2D arrays in C.
You can call this function by passing the size of the matrix, the matrix itself, the vector x, and the result vector y. For example:
int main() {
    int n = 10;
    double **A, *x, *y;
    // Initialize A, x, and y
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP support, for example with GCC: gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c

Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to represent 2D arrays. Also, the index range is 0-based in C, unlike Fortran which is 1-based.
Also, I assumed that the matrices and vectors are of type double, if you want to use float or other types, you need to adjust the code accordingly.
Please note that this code assumes that the matrices and vectors are already allocated and initialized, and that the double **A is a pointer to a pointer, where each row is a separate array.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, note that the double **A declaration assumes that the 2D array A is passed as an array of pointers to rows, which is the typical way of passing 2D arrays in C. If your 2D array is declared as a contiguous block of memory (e.g. double A[n*n]), you may need to modify the indexing accordingly.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the matrix and vectors, as Fortran's real type is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used double **A to represent the 2D matrix, as C doesn't have built-in support for 2D arrays.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as it is more common in C. If you need float precision, you can replace double with float. Also, the array A is declared as a pointer to a pointer (double **A) since C does not support 2D arrays as arguments.
Also, note that the loop indices in C start from 0, not 1 as in Fortran.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions and the arrays themselves as pointers, unlike in Fortran where the array dimensions are passed implicitly. Also, the loop indices in C start from 0, unlike in Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, note that the double **A syntax in C represents a pointer to a pointer, which is equivalent to a 2D array in Fortran.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, not 1 like in Fortran.
Also, note that the double **A syntax assumes that the 2D array A is passed as an array of pointers to rows, which is the default in C. If your C compiler supports 2D arrays with variable sizes, you can use double A[][n] instead.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the index range is 0-based in C, so we start the loops from 0 instead of 1.
Also, I assumed that the matrices and vectors are of type double, if you want to use float or other types, you should change the type accordingly.
You can call this function by passing the matrix A as a 2D array, and the vectors x and y as 1D arrays.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to arrays (double **A and double *x and double *y) instead of the Fortran matrices and vectors, and we need to adjust the loop indices to start from 0 instead of 1.
Also, I assumed that the matrices and vectors are represented as follows:
A is a 2D array of doubles, where A[i][j] represents the element at the i-th row and j-th column.
x and y are 1D arrays of doubles.
Please note that this code assumes that the matrices and vectors are already allocated and initialized. If you need help with that, please let me know!

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the index starts from 0 in C, so we adjust the loop accordingly.
Also, I assumed that the matrices and vectors are of type double, if you want to use float or any other type, you can change it accordingly.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the matrix A, vector x, and vector y as arguments, along with the size of the matrix n.
