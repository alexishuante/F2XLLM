--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as Fortran's real type is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used double **A to represent the 2D array A, as C doesn't have native support for 2D arrays like Fortran does.
Also, note that the loop indices in C start from 0, not 1, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions and the array elements themselves as separate arguments, whereas in Fortran, the array dimensions are part of the array type. Additionally, in C, we use double **A to represent a 2D array, whereas in Fortran, A(n, n) represents a 2D array.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as Fortran's real type is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used C-style arrays (double **A and double *x and double *y) instead of the Fortran-style matrices and vectors.
Please let me know if you need any further modifications!

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to arrays (double **A and double *x and double *y) instead of the Fortran matrices and vectors, and we need to adjust the loop indices to start from 0 instead of 1. Additionally, we use #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop, and private(j, sum) to specify that the variables j and sum are private to each thread.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a separate argument, and we use pointers to arrays instead of 2D arrays. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, not 1.
Also, note that the double **A declaration assumes that the 2D array A is allocated as an array of pointers to arrays, which is the typical way to allocate 2D arrays in C. If your array is allocated as a contiguous block of memory, you may need to adjust the indexing accordingly.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the standard in C. If your Fortran code uses column-major order, you would need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Additionally, the private clause in OpenMP is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copy of the j and sum variables. This is equivalent to the PRIVATE directive in Fortran.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to arrays (double **A and double *x and double *y) instead of the Fortran matrices and vectors. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C instead of 1 as in Fortran.
Also, note that the double **A is a pointer to a pointer, which is equivalent to a 2D array in Fortran. If you have a contiguous 2D array in C (e.g. double A[n][n]), you would need to modify the memory access accordingly.
You may also want to consider using a more modern C style, such as using restrict keyword to ensure aliasing safety, and using const correctness for input arguments.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to arrays (e.g., double **A) instead of 2D arrays (e.g., real, intent(in) :: A(n, n)), and we need to include the omp.h header file to use OpenMP directives.
Also, the loop indices in C typically start at 0, so we need to adjust the loop bounds accordingly.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in C. Also, the **A syntax denotes a 2D array, where each row is a pointer to a separate array.
Keep in mind that this C function uses 0-based indexing, whereas the Fortran subroutine uses 1-based indexing.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If the array is stored in column-major order, the indexing in the inner loop should be changed to A[j * n + i].
