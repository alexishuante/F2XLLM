Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can call this function from your main program like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000; // size of the matrix and vectors
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // initialize A and x with some values

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile your program with OpenMP support, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will create an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMV operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.

    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP support, e.g. using gcc with the -fopenmp flag.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array dimensions and the array itself as pointers, unlike in Fortran where arrays are passed directly. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike in Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, the double **A declaration assumes that the matrix A is stored as an array of pointers to rows, which is a common way to represent matrices in C. If your matrix is stored in a different format, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And call it from your main program like:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be in row-major order, so the indexing is done as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
You can compile and run this code using a C compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
This will compile the code and run the gemv_parallel function with the specified input arguments.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to use pointers to represent the 2D array A, and we also need to adjust the loop indices to start from 0 (instead of 1, as in Fortran).
Also, I assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. If you need to use a different type (e.g., float), you can adjust the declaration accordingly.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
You can compile and run this code using a C compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
This code will compute the matrix-vector product in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the private clause in OpenMP is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copy of the variables j and sum.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code assumes that you have already initialized the matrices A and x. The malloc function is used to allocate memory for the arrays, and the free function is used to deallocate the memory when it is no longer needed.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
To compile the C code with OpenMP, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will create an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run.
You can also use the omp_get_thread_num() function to get the thread ID and omp_get_num_threads() function to get the total number of threads, if you need them for any specific purpose.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the indexing starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1. The OpenMP pragmas are similar in both languages, with the main difference being the syntax for comments (#pragma in C, !$OMP in Fortran).
