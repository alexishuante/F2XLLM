Output 1:
#pragma acc data copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent code in C/C++ using OpenACC for the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation:

```cpp
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenACC. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses are used to manage data transfers between the CPU and GPU. The code performs the SpMV operation by iterating over non-zero elements of the sparse matrix and multiplying them with corresponding elements in the input vector `x` to update the output vector `y`.

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent version of the Fortran OpenMP code in C/C++ with OpenACC directives:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this C/C++ code snippet, we use the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the loop that performs the Sparse matrixâ€“vector multiplication operation. The `present` clause ensures that the specified arrays are present on the device before entering the parallel region.

Output 4:
Here is a version of the Fortran OpenMP code converted to C/C++ OpenACC:

```
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This version utilizes the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the loops using OpenACC. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses specify the data transfer between the host and device.

Output 5:
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
```

Output 6:
Here is a C/C++ version of the code using OpenACC for parallelization:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float val[], int row[], int col[], float x[], float y[]) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for(j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the parallelization is achieved using the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive provided by OpenACC. This directive instructs the compiler to parallelize the loop over the `i` index, which in turn will compute the SpMV operation in parallel on the GPU. The `present` clause ensures that the data used in the parallel region is made available on the GPU.

Make sure to compile this code with a compiler that supports OpenACC directives, such as PGI or Cray compilers.

Output 7:
```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
```

Output 8:
#pragma acc kernels loop present(val, row, col, x, y)
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  y[i] = 0.0;
  for(int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
    y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
  }
}

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using OpenACC directives for the Fortran OpenMP code provided:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], val[0:nnz], x[0:n], y[0:n]) copyin(n, nnz)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop in the `spmv_parallel` function. The `present` clause is used to inform the compiler about the data dependencies that need to be present on the device, and the `copyin` clause is used to copy scalar variables `n` and `nnz` to the device.

Note that you will need to include the appropriate headers and compile with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support in your C/C++ compiler. Also, make sure to adjust the data types accordingly for your specific application.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent code in C/C++ with OpenACC directives:

```c
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[0:nnz], row[0:n+1], col[0:nnz], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
```

In this version, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop in the SpMV computation using OpenACC. The input arrays `val`, `row`, `col`, and `x` are marked as `copyin`, and the output array `y` is marked as `copyout` to indicate that they are accessed in device memory.
