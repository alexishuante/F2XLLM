Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the default(none) clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause is used to specify the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and integer in Fortran corresponds to int in C. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
And then call the function from your main program.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified variables are shared among threads. Also, I've replaced the intent(in/out) attributes with the corresponding C syntax, and removed the end subroutine statement, which is not needed in C.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and I've used the same variable names as in your Fortran code for clarity. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.
The OpenMP directives are similar in both codes, with the parallel for directive in C corresponding to the PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran. The default(none) clause specifies that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause lists the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause lists the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the type accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is the most common way to parallelize SpMV. The default(none) clause specifies that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause specifies the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause specifies the variables that are private to each thread.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision, you can change the type of val, x, and y accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran. The rest of the code is similar to the Fortran version, with the main difference being the use of C-style arrays and indexing.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified variables are shared among threads. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as private to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
And then call the function spmv_parallel with the appropriate arguments.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel and #pragma omp for as in your Fortran code, which is a more concise and idiomatic way to parallelize a loop in C with OpenMP.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and integer in Fortran corresponds to int in C. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a compiler like GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
And then call the function in your program, passing in the appropriate arrays and scalars.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {

  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)

    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the types accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran. The rest of the code is similar to the Fortran version, with the main difference being the use of C-style indexing (starting from 0) instead of Fortran-style indexing (starting from 1).
