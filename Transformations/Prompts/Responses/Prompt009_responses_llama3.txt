Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the default(none) clause is used to specify that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause is used to specify the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, array indices start from 0, whereas in Fortran, they start from 1. Therefore, the loop in the C code starts from 0 and goes up to n, whereas in the Fortran code, it starts from 1 and goes up to n.
Also, the default(none) clause is used to specify that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among the threads. The private clause is used to specify the variables that are private to each thread.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler like GCC or Clang, and link it with the OpenMP library. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run to perform the sparse matrix-vector multiplication.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, the loop indices in C start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop limits accordingly.
Also, note that the OpenMP directives in C use the #pragma omp syntax, and the parallel for directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. The default(none) clause specifies that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause specifies the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause specifies the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the type accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is the same as the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran. The default(none) clause specifies that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause lists the variables that are shared among the threads. The private clause lists the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C, and I've used the default(none) clause to ensure that only the specified variables are shared among threads. Also, I've used the private clause to declare i and j as private variables for each thread.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
And then call the function spmv_parallel with the appropriate arguments.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and integer in Fortran corresponds to int in C. Also, the loop indices in C are zero-based, unlike Fortran which is one-based, so I've adjusted the loop limits accordingly.
Also, the DEFAULT(NONE) clause in OpenMP tells the compiler that none of the variables in the parallel region are shared by default, and the SHARED clause specifies the variables that are shared among threads. The PRIVATE clause specifies the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and integer corresponds to int. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, unlike Fortran which is 1-based.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the default(none) clause is used to specify that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause is used to specify the variables that are private to each thread.
You can call this function in your C program like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;  // number of rows and columns
    int nnz = 10000;  // number of non-zero elements
    double *val = malloc(nnz * sizeof(double));
    int *row = malloc((n+1) * sizeof(int));
    int *col = malloc(nnz * sizeof(int));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize val, row, col, x, and y arrays

    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    free(val);
    free(row);
    free(col);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code assumes that the val, row, col, x, and y arrays are already initialized with the appropriate values. The spmv_parallel function is then called to perform the SpMV operation, and the result is stored in the y array.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the types accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, and the default(none) clause to ensure that each thread has its own private copy of the loop indices i and j. The shared clause is used to specify the arrays that are shared among all threads.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the SpMV operation:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If you need to use a different precision (e.g., float or long double), you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the outer loop, which is the most common way to parallelize SpMV. The default(none) clause specifies that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause specifies the variables that are shared among threads. The private clause specifies the variables that are private to each thread.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler (such as GCC or Clang) and link it with the appropriate libraries (e.g., -fopenmp for GCC).
