Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array, but you can modify the data type as needed. Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as int since they are used as indices for arrays.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, the loop indices in C/C++ are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point numbers in C/C++. If you need to use a different data type, you can modify the code accordingly.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly. Also, the default(none) clause is used to specify that the variables are not shared by default, and the shared clause is used to specify the variables that are shared among the threads. The private clause is used to specify the variables that are private to each thread.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point numbers in C/C++. If you need to use a different data type, you can replace double with the appropriate type.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, the loop indices in C/C++ start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop limits accordingly.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If you need to use a different data type, you can replace double with the appropriate type.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to double in C/C++. Also, the loop indices in C/C++ are 0-based, unlike Fortran which is 1-based, so I've adjusted the loop bounds accordingly.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point numbers in C/C++. If you need to use a different data type, you can replace double with the appropriate type.
Also, the loop indices i and j are declared as int since they are used to iterate over the arrays.
The OpenMP directives are similar to the Fortran version, with the addition of default(none) to specify that no variables are shared by default, and private(i, j) to specify that the loop indices are private to each thread.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val, x, and y arrays, as it is commonly used for floating-point computations. If you need to use a different data type (e.g., float or a custom type), you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, the default(none) clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables n, nnz, val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads, while the indices i and j are private to each thread.
