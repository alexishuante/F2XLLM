Output 1:
Sure, here is a C function implementation of the above Fortran subroutine using OpenACC:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      double temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}

int main() {
  int m = 2, n = 2, k = 2;
  double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
  double a[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}; // 2x2 matrix
  double b[4] = {5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0}; // 2x2 matrix
  double c[4] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // 2x2 matrix
  
  gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, 2, b, 2, beta, c, 2);

  printf("Result matrix:\n");
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      printf("%f ", c[i * 2 + j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This C code initializes an example setup and performs the general matrix-matrix multiplication operation using OpenACC for parallelism. The results are printed to observe the behavior of the function.

Explanation of key parts of the code:

1. **pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l)**:
    - `pragma acc parallel loop` indicates the following loop should be parallelized by OpenACC.
    - `collapse(2)` tells OpenACC that the next two loops should be treated as a single entity to provide more parallelism.
    - `private(i, j, l)` ensures that each thread has its own copy of the variables `i`, `j`, and `l`.

2. **Indexing**:
    - The matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are stored in 1D arrays, so appropriate indexing is done to access respective elements.

3. **Initialization**:
    - Here, the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` have been initialized with some values. In practice, you would provide your actual matrices and values.

For running the above code, you need a compiler that supports OpenACC (e.g., PGI, GCC with OpenACC), and you must compile it with OpenACC flags enabled.

Output 2:
Sure! Here is the `gemm_parallel` function implemented in C with OpenACC. This function will calculate the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[9] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    double b[9] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    double c[9] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * m + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation
1. **Parameters**:
    - `m, n, k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
    - `alpha, beta`: Scalars for the GEMM operation.
    - `a, b`: Input matrices.
    - `lda, ldb, ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices `a, b, c` respectively.
    - `c`: Output matrix, stores the result.

2. **OpenACC Parallel Loop**:
    - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)`: Indicates that the code block inside the loop is parallel and the loop iterations are independent. The `collapse(2)` clause merges the two loops into a single large loop to improve parallel performance.

3. **Matrix Computation**:
    - The inner-most loop computes the dot product of a row of `a` and a column of `b`. This is the core computation for GEMM.
    - After computing `temp`, it is scaled by `alpha` and added to `beta` times the existing value in `c`.

4. **Example Usage**:
    - The `main` function initializes example matrices `a` and `b` and calls `gemm_parallel` to compute the matrix product. The resulting matrix `c` is printed.

### Dependencies
To compile with OpenACC support, you need a compatible compiler such as the PGI (NVIDIA) compiler:

```sh
pgcc -acc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This will compile the `gemm_parallel.c` file with OpenACC support. Adjust the command accordingly based on the compiler being used.

Output 3:
Sure! Below is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenACC that performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation matching the provided Fortran and OpenMP subroutine.

First, here's the complete function `gemm_parallel` in C that uses OpenACC for parallelization.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the outer loops using OpenACC
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 2, n = 3, k = 4;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;

    double a[2][4] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}};
    double b[4][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, {10, 11, 12}};
    double c[2][3] = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double*)a, 4, (double*)b, 3, beta, (double*)c, 3);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Notes:
1. **Use of OpenACC**: The `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)` directive instructs the compiler to parallelize the nested loops on an accelerator (e.g., a GPU). The `collapse(2)` clause indicates that both outermost loops should be collapsed into a single parallel loop.

2. **Memory Present Clauses**: The `present` clause specifies that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present on the accelerator device memory, avoiding unnecessary data movements between the host and device.

3. **Array Indexing**: Unlike Fortran, C arrays are 0-based, so the loop indices and array accesses are adjusted accordingly.

4. **Array Layout**: In C, when passing a 2D array to the function, they are handled as 1D arrays with careful indexing by row and column to match Fortran's row-major order.

Remember, for the OpenACC directives to work, you need to compile the code with an OpenACC-compatible compiler, such as the PGI (now NVIDIA HPC) compiler. The syntax for compilation depends on the compiler being used. For example:
```sh
pgcc -acc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Output 4:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent of the provided Fortran subroutine, implemented in C and using OpenACC for parallelism.

Here, you'll see the function `gemm_parallel` that performs the Generalized Matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation. The OpenACC directives are used to parallelize this matrix multiplication.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, 
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
            }
            c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 2, n = 3, k = 2;
    int lda = 2, ldb = 2, ldc = 2;
    
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;
    double a[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}; // 2x2 matrix
    double b[6] = {5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0}; // 2x3 matrix
    double c[6] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // 2x3 matrix

    #pragma acc data copyin(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n]) copy(c[0:ldc*n])
    {
        gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);
    }

    printf("Result matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i + j * ldc]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Notes on the implementation:

1. **Array Storage**: In C, matrices are stored in row-major order by default, unlike Fortran which stores them in column-major order. Here, the C matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respect the Fortran layout by manually indexing.
  
2. **OpenACC Directives**: The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loops. The `collapse(2)` clause allows the two outermost loops (j and i) to be collapsed into a single loop for parallelism. The `private` clause ensures that each thread gets its own private copy of the variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp`.

3. **Memory Management**: The `#pragma acc data` directive is used for transferring data to and from the device (GPU). The `copyin` and `copy` clauses specify that arrays `a` and `b` are copied to the device, and array `c` is both copied to the device and back to the host.

### Compilation:
To compile this code, you need an OpenACC-compatible compiler, such as PGI or NVHPC. Below is an example compilation command using the NVHPC compiler:

```bash
nvc -acc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

You can replace the `nvc` with the appropriate compiler command if using a different OpenACC-enabled compiler.

Output 5:
To convert the Fortran subroutine `gemm_parallel` that uses OpenMP to a C function using OpenACC, we can closely follow the same logic while adapting it to C syntax and using OpenACC directives for parallelization. Below is the implementation:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Data Layout in C vs Fortran:** C uses 0-based indexing and row-major order for arrays, while Fortran uses 1-based indexing and column-major order. Therefore, we need to access elements properly to match the equivalent behavior.
- **Private Variables:** The OpenACC directive `private(i, j, l)` specifies which variables are private to each thread.
- **Data Mapping:** `present` clause in OpenACC ensures that the data is already present on the device. If the data is not already on the device, you may need to use `copyin` and `copyout` or `create` clauses accordingly.
- **Reduction:** The `reduction(+:temp)` clause in OpenACC is used to accumulate the value of `temp` for each iteration of the `l` loop.

Ensure that arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are either already allocated on the device or appropriately managed with data directives if not initially present. Adjustments may be necessary based on the surrounding code that manages these arrays.

Output 6:
To translate the provided Fortran subroutine (which uses OpenMP) for Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) into a C function using OpenACC, we need to follow these steps:

1. Declare the function parameters following C conventions.
2. Implement the nested loops that perform the matrix multiplication.
3. Use OpenACC directives to parallelize the loops.

Given the provided Fortran subroutine, here is its equivalent implementation in C using OpenACC:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc);

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelization with OpenACC
    #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }

}

int main() {
    // Sample data for testing
    // In practice, these should be dynamically allocated if sizes are large
    int m = 2, n = 2, k = 2;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[2][2] = {{1.0, 2.0}, {3.0, 4.0}};
    double b[2][2] = {{5.0, 6.0}, {7.0, 8.0}};
    double c[2][2] = {{9.0, 10.0}, {11.0, 12.0}};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double *)a, 2, (double *)b, 2, beta, (double *)c, 2);

    // Print result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Function Parameters**: 
  - `m`, `n`, `k` are the dimensions of the matrices.
  - `alpha`, `beta` are the scalar multipliers.
  - `a`, `b`, `c` are pointers to the matrices.
  - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc` are the leading dimensions of the matrices.

- **Indexing**:
  - The matrices in C are accessed using row-major order. The index formula used is `matrix[row * leading_dimension + column]`.

- **OpenACC Directives**:
  - `#pragma acc parallel loop` allows for the parallel execution of the nested loops.
  - `private(i, j, l, temp)` ensures that each thread has its local copies of the variables.
  - `collapse(2)` merges the two nested loops into a single loop to increase parallelism.

- **Main Function**:
  - The main function demonstrates a sample call to the `gemm_parallel` function with a 2x2 matrix and prints the result.

This implementation assumes that the matrices fit into the memory available and does not handle dynamic memory allocation for larger matrices. For real-world applications, appropriate dynamic allocation should be implemented based on the sizes of the matrices.

Output 7:
Sure! Below is the equivalent C function with OpenACC directives to perform a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation. 

Here's the C version:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matrix Indexing**:
   - In C, matrices are typically stored in row-major order, so we adjust the indexing accordingly.
   
2. **OpenACC Directives**:
   - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2)`: This directive indicates that the outermost two loops should be parallelized.
   - `present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])`: Ensures that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present on the device.
   - `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)`: The `reduction` clause ensures that `temp` is correctly reduced across the loop iterations.

By converting this subroutine for use with OpenACC, it allows for leveraging GPU acceleration in a C environment. Ensure proper compilation with an OpenACC-compatible compiler such as PGI or GCC (with OpenACC support).

Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenACC for the given Fortran subroutine using OpenMP. This function performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, 
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma acc parallel loop private(i, j, l, temp) present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i + l*lda] * b[l + j*ldb];
            }
            c[i + j*ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j*ldc];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:

    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[3][3] = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 
                      {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, 
                      {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}};
    double b[3][3] = {{9.0, 8.0, 7.0}, 
                      {6.0, 5.0, 4.0}, 
                      {3.0, 2.0, 1.0}};
    double c[3][3] = {{0.0, 0.0, 0.0}, 
                      {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}, 
                      {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}};

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double *)a, 3, (double *)b, 3, beta, (double *)c, 3);

    printf("Result matrix C:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Parameters**:
    - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices involved.
    - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalar multipliers.
    - `a`, `b`: Input matrices with dimensions `m x k` and `k x n` respectively.
    - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions (strides) of the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    - `c`: Output matrix with dimensions `m x n`.

2. **OpenACC Directives**:
    - `#pragma acc parallel loop`: This directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `j`, and additionally private copies of `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are created for each thread. 
    - `present(a[0:lda*k], b[0:ldb*n], c[0:ldc*n])`: Indicates that these arrays are already present on the device.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**:
    - The loops iterate over the dimensions of the matrices `c`, computing the product `a[i, l] * b[l, j]` and updating the values of matrix `c` as `alpha * temp + beta * c[i, j]`.

4. **Main function**:
    - Provides an example of how to call the GEMM function and demonstrates its usage.

To compile this program, you need to link with the OpenACC compiler. For example, if you are using PGI (NVIDIA HPC SDK), you can compile it using:
```sh
pgcc -acc -Minfo=accel -o gemm gemm.c
```

Make sure to adapt the compilation command if you are using a different compiler with OpenACC support.

Output 9:
Sure, here is the C version of the Fortran subroutine that uses OpenACC for parallelization:

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda,
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i,j,l,temp) present(a[0:m*k], b[0:k*n], c[0:m*n])
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
      }
      c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The function signature corresponds to the Fortran subroutine, with array indexing starting from 0 in C.
2. The OpenACC directive `#pragma acc parallel loop` is used to parallelize the outer two loops (iterating over j and i), equivalent to OpenMP's parallel for loop.
3. `collapse(2)` ensures that the parallel region covers both the outer loops.
4. `private(i,j,l,temp)` specifies that these variables should be private to each parallel thread.
5. `present(a[0:m*k], b[0:k*n], c[0:m*n])` indicates that the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are already present in the GPU memory, and avoids unnecessary copying between the host and device memory.

This C function uses OpenACC to achieve parallelization similar to the OpenMP directives in the original Fortran subroutine. It should be compiled with an OpenACC-compatible compiler like PGI or GCC with OpenACC support.

Output 10:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function that achieves the same Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenACC for parallelization.

```c
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) independent
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
            for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature:**
   - The function `gemm_parallel` takes parameters similar to the Fortran subroutine.
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: scaling factors.
   - `a`, `b`: input matrices.
   - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.
   - `c`: output matrix.

2. **Matrix Indices:**
   - Matrix `a` is stored in a row-major order, and similarly for matrices `b` and `c`.

3. **OpenACC Directives:**
   - `#pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) independent`: Initiates parallel execution of the nested loops with collapsing the loops for better performance.
   - `#pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)`: The inner product loop uses a reduction clause to safely sum the values of `temp` across parallel threads.

### Important Notes:
- OpenACC directives are similar to OpenMP but are designed to offload computations to accelerators such as GPUs.
- Ensure that all matrix dimensions and leading dimensions are correctly passed to the function, as these values are crucial for correct indexing and data layout.
- OpenACC compiler and runtime must be correctly set up in your development environment to utilize these parallel directives.

This C function should provide similar performance benefits on supported hardware as the original Fortran subroutine using OpenMP.
