Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop seq
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, and the private clause is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
To compile this code, you would use a command like:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
This will compile the code and generate a parallel version of the GEMM routine that can be executed on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the lda and ldb parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the arrays a and b, respectively.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine for the host, in addition to the parallel version for the accelerator.
To use this function with OpenACC, you would need to include the OpenACC header (#include <openacc.h>), and call the function inside a parallel region, like this:
int main() {
  int m = 100, n = 100, k = 100;
  double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
  double *a, *b, *c;
  // Allocate memory for a, b, and c
  // ...

  #pragma acc data create(a[:m*k], b[:k*n], c[:m*n]) copyout(c[:m*n])
  {
    #pragma acc parallel present(a, b, c)
    {
      gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);
    }
  }
  // ...
}
This code snippet allocates memory for the matrices a, b, and c, and copies the data to the accelerator using the #pragma acc data directive. Then, it calls the gemm_parallel function inside a parallel region, using the #pragma acc parallel directive. The present clause ensures that the data is already present on the accelerator, so it doesn't need to be copied again.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively. Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) directive is used to perform a reduction operation on the temp variable.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding

interface
  subroutine gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc) bind(C)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(C_INT), intent(in) :: m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc
    real(C_DOUBLE), intent(in) :: alpha, beta
    real(C_DOUBLE), intent(in) :: a(lda, k), b(ldb, n)
    real(C_DOUBLE), intent(inout) :: c(ldc, n)
  end subroutine gemm_parallel
end interface

call gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc)
Note that you'll need to compile the C code with the -fopenacc flag to enable OpenACC support.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {

      #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp)
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c. Also, the reduction clause is used to specify that the variable temp is a reduction variable, and OpenACC will take care of synchronizing the updates to it.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 6:

    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively.
Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:temp) directive is used to perform a reduction on the temp variable, which is necessary because the loop is parallelized.

      }

    }

}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the arrays, which are necessary for correct memory access.
The #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, while the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop. The collapse(2) clause tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, and the private clause specifies that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.

}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the pragma directive tells the compiler to collapse the two outer loops into a single loop, which can be parallelized. The reduction(+:temp) clause tells the compiler to perform a reduction on the variable temp using the + operator.
Also, note that in OpenACC, the parallel directive is used to specify the parallel region, and the loop directive is used to specify the loops that should be parallelized. The collapse clause is used to specify the loops that should be collapsed, and the reduction clause is used to specify the reduction operation that should be performed.
You can compile this code using a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as the PGI compiler, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.
