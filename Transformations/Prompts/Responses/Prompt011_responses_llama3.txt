Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc kernels
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, not 1, as in Fortran.
To compile, use:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
You can then call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module:
use iso_c_binding
interface
  subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y) bind(c)
    use iso_c_binding
    integer(c_int), value :: n
    real(c_float), value :: a
    real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
  end subroutine saxpy
end interface
Let me know if you need further assistance!


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
  #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily modify the code to use double or other precisions as needed.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc kernels directive to specify the parallel kernel, and #pragma acc end kernels to mark the end of the kernel. This is similar to the !$acc kernels and !$acc end kernels directives used in the Fortran code.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC and parallel loops:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so x and y are pointers to the first element of the arrays. The float * syntax declares a pointer to a float. The #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to generate an OpenACC kernel for the following loop, and the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop across the accelerator device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C and OpenACC code for the given Fortran and OpenACC subroutine:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the x and y arrays are declared as pointers. Also, the loop index i starts from 0 instead of 1, as C arrays are 0-indexed.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support. For example:
gcc -fopenacc saxpy.c -o saxpy
Or:
pgcc -acc saxpy.c -o saxpy


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC, using the restrict keyword to clarify the pointer aliasing:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float * restrict x, float * restrict y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to explicitly specify the size of the arrays x and y using pointers, whereas in Fortran, the size is implicit in the array declarations. Also, the restrict keyword is used to indicate that the pointers x and y do not alias each other.
Also, note that the loop index i starts from 0 in C, whereas it starts from 1 in Fortran. This is because C uses zero-based indexing, whereas Fortran uses one-based indexing.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <Accelerator/Accelerator.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to arrays of floats. Also, the loop index i starts at 0, not 1, as in C arrays are 0-indexed.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you would use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc, with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support. For example:
pgcc -acc saxpy.c -o saxpy
This would compile the saxpy.c file and generate an executable file saxpy that can run on a GPU or other accelerator.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stddef.h>

void saxpy(const int n, const float a, const float * restrict x, float * restrict y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, we use restrict keyword to ensure that the pointers x and y do not point to the same memory location.
And here is the equivalent C++ code using OpenACC:
#include <stddef.h>

void saxpy(const int n, const float a, const float * restrict x, float * restrict y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
In C++, we use restrict keyword similar to C.
Please note that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model for parallel programming on accelerators, and the implementation may vary depending on the compiler and hardware architecture.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc kernels
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are declared as pointers to float. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, unlike in Fortran where it starts from 1.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler like pgcc (from the Portland Group) or gcc (with the OpenACC plugin):
pgcc -acc -o saxpy saxpy.c
Or
gcc -fopenacc -o saxpy saxpy.c
You can then run the program using the acc command:
acc saxpy
This will execute the SAXPY operation on the GPU (if available) or CPU (if no GPU is available).


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop index i is declared as an int, which is the usual type for array indices in C.
To compile this code, you would use a command like:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
This will create an executable file saxpy that you can run on your system.
Here is the equivalent C++ code using OpenACC:
#include <iostream>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
The main difference between the C and C++ versions is the use of iostream in C++ for input/output operations.
You can compile the C++ code using a command like:
g++ -o saxpy saxpy.cpp -lOpenACC
This will create an executable file saxpy that you can run on your system.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent Fortran code using OpenACC:
subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y)
  implicit none
  integer, intent(in) :: n
  real, intent(in) :: a
  real, intent(in) :: x(n)
  real, intent(inout) :: y(n)
  !$acc kernels
  do concurrent (i = 1:n)
    y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
  end do
  !$acc end kernels
end subroutine saxpy
Note that in the C version, I've used float instead of real to match the typical C convention, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels instead of !$acc kernels which is the syntax used in C/C++ for OpenACC directives.
