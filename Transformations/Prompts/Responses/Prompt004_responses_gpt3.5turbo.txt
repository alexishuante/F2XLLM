Output 1:
Here is the C function implemented using OpenMP that performs a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this function:
- `n` is the size of the matrix and vectors.
- `A` is a pointer to the matrix stored in row-major order.
- `x` is a pointer to the input vector.
- `y` is a pointer to the output vector.

The loop over matrix-vector multiplication is parallelized using `#pragma omp parallel for`.

Please note that the indices in C start from 0 compared to Fortran where they start from 1. Additionally, the matrix `A` is stored in row-major order in the C implementation.

Output 2:
```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

Output 3:
Sure! Here is the equivalent C code implemented using OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP. The `private(j, sum)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of the loop variables `j` and `sum`.

Output 4:
Here is a function implemented in C with OpenMP that computes a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP to parallelize the computation of the GEMV operation similar to the Fortran subroutine using OpenACC. Note that the array indexing is different between C and Fortran, so the index calculation inside the loop is adjusted accordingly.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine implementing GEMV operation with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP, similar to the `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP` directive in the Fortran code using OpenACC. The `private(sum, j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the `sum` and `j` variables.

You can call this `gemv_parallel` function in your C program to perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation in parallel using OpenMP.

Output 6:
Below is the C function with OpenMP that implements the equivalent functionality to the Fortran subroutine using OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP. The `private(j, sum)` clause is added to ensure that each thread working on the loop has its own private copy of variables `j` and `sum`.

This function performs a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation in a similar way to the Fortran subroutine. Note that the loop indexes start from 0 (as in C language) instead of 1 (as in Fortran).

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i,j,sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` in a similar fashion to the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC. The `private(i,j,sum)` clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of loop variables to prevent race conditions.

Output 8:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for(j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

```

Output 9:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenMP that performs the equivalent Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP.

Both the Fortran subroutine and the C function perform the same GEMV operation but with different syntax and parallelization directives specific to their respective languages and parallel programming models (OpenACC for Fortran and OpenMP for C).

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, we use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop and distribute the iterations among multiple threads using OpenMP. The private clause is used to declare `j` and `sum` as private variables to each thread.
