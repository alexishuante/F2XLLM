Output 1:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenMP that replicates the functionality of the Fortran subroutine provided:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, `A` is assumed to be a 1D array representing the 2D array `A(n, n)` in Fortran, with elements accessed using row-major order. The function also takes 1D arrays `x` and `y` as input for the vector operands. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used in OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the OpenACC directive used in the Fortran subroutine.

Output 2:
Here is a function implemented in C and OpenMP that performs the same operation as the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC for Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV):

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop and distribute the work among multiple threads. This allows for concurrent execution of the iterations of the loop, speeding up the computation for large matrices.

Output 3:
Here is the C function implemented using OpenMP that corresponds to the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for shared(A, x, y) private(i, j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the outer loop and distribute the work among threads. The `private` clause is used to declare private variables `i`, `j`, and `sum` for each thread, ensuring that each thread has its own copy of these variables.

Please note that the indexing in the C function is adjusted to match the row-major order used in Fortran (i.e., accessing elements of a 2D array stored in linear memory).

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum = sum + A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP directives to parallelize the loop over `i` and includes the private clause to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the loop index `j` and the accumulator `sum`, preventing race conditions.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, similar to the `!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP` directive in the Fortran version. This will distribute the iterations of the `i` loop across multiple threads in an OpenMP parallel region.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP for the given subroutine in Fortran with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this function, we use OpenMP directives to parallelize the outer loop over `i` in C. The `private(i, j, sum)` clause specifies that each thread should have its own private copies of variables `i`, `j`, and `sum` to avoid data races.

Output 7:
```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n+j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

Output 8:
Sure, here is a corresponding function in C and OpenMP that implements the GEMV operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to distribute the loop iterations among threads for parallel execution. It is equivalent to the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC for computing the GEMV operation.

Output 9:
The C implementation using OpenMP for the GEMV operation is as follows:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C implementation uses OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop for improved performance.

Both the Fortran and the C implementations achieve the same result, which is computing the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation in parallel using OpenACC and OpenMP, respectively.

Output 10:
Sure! Here is a C function implemented using OpenMP that performs the same Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation as the Fortran subroutine using OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, we use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop over `i`, with the `private(j)` clause to ensure each thread has its own copy of the loop index `j`. The rest of the code is essentially the same as the Fortran subroutine, performing the matrix-vector multiplication and storing the result in the `y` array.

Please note that you will need to compile this code with OpenMP support enabled.
