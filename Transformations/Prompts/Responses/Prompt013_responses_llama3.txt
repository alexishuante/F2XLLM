Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, OpenACC uses a different syntax to parallelize loops. The kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop, and the loop directive specifies the type of parallelism. In this case, we use independent to indicate that each iteration of the loop can be executed independently. The reduction clause is used to perform a reduction operation (in this case, sum) in parallel.
You can compile this code using a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, and the routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine for the host. The gang vector directive parallelizes the loop across gangs and vectors, and the reduction directive performs a reduction on the sum variable.
Also, note that in C, arrays are row-major, so the indexing is reversed compared to Fortran.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using ISO_C_BINDING.
Let me know if you need further help!


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop seq
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be called from a GPU kernel. The #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector directive parallelizes the outer loop across gangs (blocks) and vectors (threads), and the #pragma acc loop seq directive tells the compiler to execute the inner loop sequentially.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and array indices are accessed using pointer arithmetic. Also, the private clause in OpenACC is used to specify that the j and sum variables are private to each thread, and the reduction clause is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable.
To compile this code, you would use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc with the accel plugin. For example:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and array indices are represented as offsets from the starting address of the array. Therefore, the 2D array A is represented as a 1D array, and the index calculation A(i, j) is replaced with A[i * n + j].
Also, the #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive tells the compiler to perform a reduction on the variable sum in the inner loop.
You can call this function on the host or on the device, depending on your needs. If you want to call it on the device, you need to copy the data to the device first, and then copy the result back to the host. Here is an example of how to do this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *A, *x, *y;

    // Allocate memory on the host
    A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize data on the host
    // ...

    // Copy data to the device
    float *A_d, *x_d, *y_d;
    cudaMalloc((void **)&A_d, n * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&x_d, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void **)&y_d, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMemcpy(A_d, A, n * n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(x_d, x, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Call the function on the device
    gemv_parallel(n, A_d, x_d, y_d);

    // Copy result back to the host
    cudaMemcpy(y, y_d, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Free memory on the device
    cudaFree(A_d);
    cudaFree(x_d);
    cudaFree(y_d);

    // Free memory on the host
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code uses the CUDA runtime API to copy data to the device, call the function, and copy the result back to the host. You can use the OpenACC runtime API instead, depending on your needs.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma acc data copy(A[:n*n], x[:n], y[:n])
    #pragma acc parallel loop private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable, which is equivalent to the implicit reduction in the OpenMP version.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc (Portland Group C Compiler) or gcc with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
pgcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c -lacml
This will compile the code and link it with the ACML library, which provides optimized BLAS routines, including GEMV.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive specifies that the sum variable is a reduction variable.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you would use a compiler such as pgcc or nvc++ with the -acc flag. For example:
pgcc -acc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate a parallel executable that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, OpenACC uses #pragma acc kernels to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) to perform the reduction on the sum variable.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the Portland Group, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {

  #pragma acc data copy(A(:,:), x(:), y(:))
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable, which is equivalent to the PRIVATE clause in OpenMP.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:

        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to adjust the indexing in the inner loop accordingly. Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable, which is a common pattern in parallel computing.
To compile this code, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc with the accel plugin. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -Minfo=accel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate a CUDA kernel that performs the GEMV operation in parallel on the GPU.
