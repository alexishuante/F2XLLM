Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and array indices are 0-based, unlike in Fortran where they are 1-based. Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to specify that the sum variable is a reduction variable, and OpenACC will automatically perform the reduction operation at the end of the parallel loop.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and we use float instead of real since C does not have a built-in real type. Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive is used to specify that the sum variable is a reduction variable, which allows the parallel loop to correctly compute the sum.
To compile this code, you would use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
pgcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c -lacml
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is done as A[i * n + j].
The #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells OpenACC to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive tells OpenACC to perform a reduction operation on the sum variable, which is necessary for the GEMV operation.
You can call this function from your main program, passing in the necessary arguments, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize A, x, and y here...

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the resulting y array here...

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile your program with the OpenACC compiler and link against the OpenACC runtime library. The exact compilation and linking commands may vary depending on your system and compiler.

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *A = (float *)malloc(n * n * sizeof(float));
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize A and x
    // ...

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y
    // ...

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the Portland Group, using the -acc flag:
pgcc -acc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate a parallel version of the GEMV operation that can be executed on a GPU or other accelerator device.

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and array indices are calculated manually using the * operator. Also, the #pragma acc parallel loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop directive tells the compiler to parallelize the inner loop.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI compiler suite, using the -acc flag:
pgcc -acc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device supported by OpenACC.

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).

Output 8:

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are stored in row-major order, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran.
Also, I assumed that the arrays A, x, and y are already allocated and initialized on the device (GPU) before calling this function. If that's not the case, you'll need to add additional OpenACC directives to manage data transfers between host and device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to manually calculate the index in the array A using i * n + j. Also, the loop indices i and j start from 0 in C, whereas in Fortran they start from 1.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as pgcc (from the Portland Group) or gcc (with the OpenACC plugin) and link with the OpenACC library. For example:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate a parallel executable that can run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to manually handle array indexing, whereas in Fortran, the compiler takes care of it. Also, the reduction clause in OpenACC ensures that the summation is done correctly in parallel.
Also, please note that the above C code assumes that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If A is stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you would need to swap the indices in the array access, i.e., A[j * n + i].
