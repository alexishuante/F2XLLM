Output 1:
Here is a function implemented in C with OpenMP that performs the same AXPY operation as the given Fortran subroutine with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float x[], float y[]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loop iteration with OpenMP, just like the `!$acc kernels` directive in the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC.

To use this C function with OpenMP, you can compile it with a command like:

```
gcc -fopenmp saxpy.c -o saxpy_openmp
```

And then call it from your program by passing the array sizes `n`, the scalar `a`, and the arrays `x` and `y`:

```c
int main() {
    int n = 10;
    float a = 2.0;
    float x[n] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0};
    float y[n] = {10.0, 9.0, 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0};
    
    saxpy(n, a, x, y);
    
    // Print resulting y values
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
``` 

This will perform the AXPY operation in parallel using OpenMP in C.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

Both versions of the subroutine perform the AXPY operation in parallel, with the Fortran version using OpenACC directives and the C version using OpenMP directives.

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP for the Fortran subroutine implementing AXPY operation with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the OpenMP directive `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the loop that performs the AXPY operation. The function `saxpy` takes the same parameters as the Fortran subroutine and performs the same computation.

Output 4:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenMP that performs the AXPY operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenMP.

Please note that the data types used in the C implementation (float) should match the data types used in the Fortran implementation (real).

Also, make sure to link your C code with the OpenMP library by adding `-fopenmp` flag when compiling.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to distribute the loop iteration across multiple threads for parallel execution.

Please note that the code assumes that `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` are properly allocated and initialized before calling the `saxpy` function.

Output 6:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    float a = 2.0;
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
    float y[] = {6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0};

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    printf("Result: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loop over the array elements using OpenMP.

Note: Make sure to compile the C code with OpenMP support enabled by using `-fopenmp` or equivalent option in the compiler command.

Output 8:
Here is an equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP that performs the AXPY operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, the OpenMP directive `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the loop that performs the AXPY operation.

Note: Please make sure to include the necessary header files and compiler flags for OpenMP when compiling this code.

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP that performs an AXPY operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenMP.

Note: The variable types and other specific details may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your program.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, the OpenMP directive `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the loop that performs the AXPY operation. Each iteration of the loop will be executed in parallel by different threads.

Please note that in this C function, the input array `x` and output array `y` are passed as pointers rather than arrays, as in Fortran. Additionally, the data type `float` is used instead of `real`, as they are equivalent in this context.
