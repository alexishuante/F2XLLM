Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
./saxpy_parallel
This will compute the AXPY operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran which starts from 1.
You can call this function from your main program, passing the appropriate arguments. Don't forget to include the OpenMP header (#include <omp.h>) and link the OpenMP library when compiling.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, not 1, as in C arrays are 0-indexed.
You can call this function in a similar way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the length of the arrays n, the scalar a, and the arrays x and y.
Let me know if you need any further assistance!


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices in C typically start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop accordingly.
You can compile and run this code using a C compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC or Clang, with the -fopenmp flag.
Example compilation command:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
This will generate an executable file saxpy_parallel that you can run with the appropriate inputs.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the AXPY operation:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the following for loop across multiple threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations.
You can call this function from your main program, passing in the appropriate arguments, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    // Use the resulting y array...

    free(x);
    free(y);
    return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the for loop, dividing the iterations among the available threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop, and the results will be combined at the end.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop indices in C typically start from 0, so I've adjusted the loop accordingly.
To compile and run this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler like GCC or Clang, and link with the OpenMP library. For example:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
./saxpy_parallel
This will compile the code and run it using the default number of threads. You can control the number of threads using the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop index i starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where it starts from 1.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy_parallel.c -o saxpy_parallel
And then call the function saxpy_parallel from your main program.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed.
Also, I've used the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loop, which is equivalent to the !$OMP PARALLEL DO directive in Fortran.
You can call this function from your main program, passing in the appropriate arguments, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y);

    // Use the resulting y array...

    free(x);
    free(y);
    return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop, and the for loop is the equivalent of the do loop in Fortran.
