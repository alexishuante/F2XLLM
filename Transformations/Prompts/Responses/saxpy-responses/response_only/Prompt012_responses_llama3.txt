Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop independent directive is used to indicate that the loop iterations are independent and can be parallelized.
To compile this code, you would use a command like:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
This will generate an executable file saxpy that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the array lengths explicitly, and we use float instead of real for the floating-point type. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
This will generate an executable file saxpy that you can run on your system.
You can also use a more modern OpenACC syntax, which is similar to the Fortran code:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc kernels
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
This code uses the acc kernels directive to specify the parallel region, and the for loop is automatically parallelized by the OpenACC compiler.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, unlike in Fortran where it starts from 1.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc saxpy.c -o saxpy
This will generate an executable file saxpy that you can run on a GPU or CPU.

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop independent directive is used to indicate that the loop can be parallelized.
To compile, use:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
You can also use the following OpenACC flags to enable parallelization:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC -acc -ta=nvidia
This will compile the code for NVIDIA GPUs.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent subroutine in C and OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent subroutine in Fortran and OpenACC:
subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y)
  implicit none
  integer, intent(in) :: n
  real, intent(in) :: a
  real, intent(in) :: x(n)
  real, intent(inout) :: y(n)
  integer :: i
  !$acc parallel loop
  do i = 1, n
    y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
  end do
end subroutine saxpy
Note that in the C version, I assumed float precision for the scalars and arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, I used #pragma acc kernels to create an OpenACC kernel, which is equivalent to !$acc kernels in Fortran.
Also, in the Fortran version, I replaced !$acc kernels with !$acc parallel loop to create a parallel loop, which is a more modern and efficient way to parallelize loops in OpenACC.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, not 1, as in C arrays are 0-indexed.
To compile, use:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
And to run, use:
./saxpy <n> <a> <x_file> <y_file>
Where <x_file> and <y_file> contain the input arrays x and y, respectively.
You can also use the following OpenACC API calls to get the device number and use it to set the device for the kernel execution:
int dev = acc_get_num_devices(acc_device_nvidia);
#pragma acc set device_num(dev)
This way you can control on which device the kernel will be executed.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
#pragma acc kernels
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
#pragma acc end kernels
}
And here is the equivalent Fortran code using OpenACC:
subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real, intent(in) :: a
    real, intent(in) :: x(n)
    real, intent(inout) :: y(n)
    integer :: i
    !$acc kernels
    do i = 1, n
        y(i) = a * x(i) + y(i)
    end do
    !$acc end kernels
end subroutine saxpy
Note that in C, I used float instead of real since C does not have a built-in real type. Also, I used float * for the arrays x and y since C uses pointers for array parameters.
To compile the C code, you can use a command like:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
And to compile the Fortran code, you can use a command like:
pgfortran -o saxpy saxpy.f90 -lOpenACC
Both codes should produce the same result, which is the AXPY operation: y = a * x + y.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so x and y are pointers to the first element of the arrays. The loop independent directive is used to indicate that the iterations of the loop can be executed independently, allowing the compiler to parallelize the loop.
Also, the float type is used instead of real, as C does not have a built-in real type. If you want to use double precision, you can replace float with double.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the size of the arrays, the scalar a, and the arrays x and y.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc kernels
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    #pragma acc end kernels
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to floats. Also, the loop index i starts from 0, unlike in Fortran where it starts from 1.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler like pgcc or gcc with the -acc flag. For example:
pgcc -acc saxpy.c -o saxpy
This will generate an executable file saxpy that can be run on a GPU or CPU, depending on the OpenACC runtime configuration.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc kernels
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so x and y are pointers to float. Also, the loop independent directive is used to indicate that the loop iterations are independent and can be parallelized.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -o saxpy saxpy.c -lOpenACC
This will generate an executable file saxpy that you can run on a device that supports OpenACC.
