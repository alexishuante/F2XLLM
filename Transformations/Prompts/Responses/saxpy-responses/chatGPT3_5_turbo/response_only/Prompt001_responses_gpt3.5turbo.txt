Output 1:
Here is a C function implemented with OpenMP that performs the AXPY operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float x[], float y[]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the for loop and distribute the iterations among the available threads.

Note: Make sure to compile your C code with OpenMP support enabled. On GCC, you can use the `-fopenmp` flag.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP for the AXPY operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used with a `for` loop to parallelize the operation across multiple threads. Each thread will calculate a portion of the array `y` based on the value of `i`.

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, we use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the loop over `n` elements. This directive creates multiple threads that will work on different iterations of the loop in parallel.

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP directives to parallelize the loop and perform the AXPY operation.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C code, we use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the for loop, which is equivalent to the `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` directive in Fortran with OpenMP.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP for the given subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this C function, we use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the loop that performs the AXPY operation. The loop will be divided among the available threads for parallel execution.

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loop, making use of OpenMP to distribute the iterations of the loop among available threads for better performance.

Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
``` 

This C function performs the same AXPY operation as the Fortran subroutine using OpenMP to parallelize the loop iteration.

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP pragma directive `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the loop iteration across multiple threads.

Output 10:
Here is the same function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
```

This C function performs the same AXPY operation as the Fortran subroutine but using C syntax with OpenMP directives for parallel execution.
