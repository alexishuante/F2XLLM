Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(x[:n], y[:n])
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in the OpenACC version, I used the present clause to ensure that the x and y arrays are present on the device. In the OpenMP version, I used the parallel for directive to parallelize the loop.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent subroutine in C with OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the x and y arrays are declared as pointers. The const keyword is used to indicate that the function does not modify the x array.
The #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback if the OpenACC version is not supported.
The #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y) directive tells the compiler to parallelize the loop and specifies that the x and y arrays are present on the device.
Also, note that the loop index i starts from 0, unlike in Fortran where it starts from 1. This is because C arrays are 0-based, meaning the first element is at index 0.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent subroutine in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        y[i-1] = a * x[i-1] + y[i-1];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so we need to adjust the index accordingly. Also, the present clause in the #pragma acc directive ensures that the arrays x and y are present on the device.
And here is the equivalent subroutine in C++ with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
In C++, we can use the same indexing as in Fortran, and the present clause is still used to ensure that the arrays are present on the device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the x and y arguments are declared as float *. Also, the loop index i is declared as an integer, and the loop bounds are adjusted accordingly.
The OpenACC and OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the loop, similar to the OpenMP directive in the Fortran code.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the x and y arguments are declared as pointers to float. Also, the loop indices are usually declared as integers, so the i variable is declared as an int.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in the OpenACC version, I used the present clause to ensure that the x and y arrays are present on the accelerator device. In the OpenMP version, I used the parallel for directive to parallelize the loop.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent subroutine in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
And here is the equivalent subroutine in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the x and y arguments are declared as float *. Also, the intent and implicit none statements are not needed in C, and the integer type is not needed for the loop index i (it is implicitly an int).


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily modify the function to use double precision if needed.
Also, the present clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that the arrays x and y are present on the device (GPU) before executing the parallel loop.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding

interface
    subroutine saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y) bind(C)
        use iso_c_binding
        integer(c_int), value :: n
        real(c_float), value :: a
        real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
    end subroutine saxpy_parallel
end interface

call saxpy_parallel(n, a, x, y)
Make sure to compile your Fortran code with the -c flag to generate an object file, and then link it with the C object file generated from the OpenACC code using the -lacc flag.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent subroutine in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma acc parallel loop
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
And here is the equivalent subroutine in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
  int i;
  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so the x and y arguments are declared as float *. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, as it is implied by the function signature.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    int i;
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        y[i-1] = a * x[i-1] + y[i-1];
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so we use y[i-1] and x[i-1] instead of y(i) and x(i).
Also, the present clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that the arrays x and y are present on the device (GPU) before executing the parallel loop.
You can compile this code with a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.
