Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability) is an open-source software development framework that allows developers to write performance-portable code for various devices, including GPUs and CPUs.
In this code, the gemv_parallel function launches the gemv_kernel kernel on the HIP device. The kernel performs the matrix-vector multiplication in parallel, with each thread handling a single row of the matrix.
Also, note that this is a simplified example and may not include error checking and other features that a production-ready implementation would require.


Output 2:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

  // GEMVKernel is a __global__ function (executed on the GPU)
  // that performs the actual matrix-vector multiplication
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that executes on the GPU. The kernel function performs the same matrix-vector multiplication as the original Fortran code.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the AMD ROCm compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Also, you can use hipify tool to migrate your code to HIP, it will handle the kernel launch and data management for you.
hipify --cpp gemv_parallel.f90
This will generate a HIP version of your code in C++.
Please let me know if you need more help.


Output 3:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to CUDA but allows for cross-platform portability between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The hipLaunchKernel function launches the GEMVKernel kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU. The kernel itself is similar to the OpenACC version, with the main difference being the use of blockIdx, blockDim, and threadIdx to compute the global thread index i.


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is launched with a block size of 1 and a grid size equal to the number of rows in the matrix A.
Also, note that this code assumes that the matrices and vectors are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. If your Fortran code uses column-major order, you may need to transpose the matrices and vectors before passing them to the HIP kernel.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 5:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(n), dim3(256), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[idx * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[idx] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is written in CUDA C++ and performs the same computation as the original Fortran OpenACC code.
Also, note that the matrix A is assumed to be stored in column-major order, as is typical in Fortran. If your matrix is stored in row-major order (as is typical in C/C++), you'll need to adjust the indexing in the kernel accordingly.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler (such as the HIP-clang compiler) and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(n), dim3(1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

  // GEMVKernel is a __global__ function (kernel) that is executed on the GPU
  // it is launched with 'n' blocks, each containing 1 thread
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x; // each block is responsible for one row of the matrix
  float sum = 0.0;

  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
  }

  y[i] = sum;
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to the OpenACC API, but is specific to AMD GPUs. The hipLaunchKernel function is used to launch the kernel (the GEMVKernel function) on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU.
Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may want to add error checking and other features depending on your use case.
You can also use HIPify tool to convert OpenACC code to HIP code, it can be done by running the command hipify --convert --launch-config <input_file>.c --config <config_file>.txt , it will generate the HIP equivalent code.

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code using HIP (for AMD GPUs) for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(1, 1, 1), dim3(n, 1, 1), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
This code uses HIP to launch a kernel on the GPU, which performs the matrix-vector multiplication in parallel. The kernel is executed by multiple threads, each of which computes a single element of the output vector y.
Note that this code assumes that the matrix A and the vectors x and y are already allocated and copied to the GPU. You may need to add additional code to handle memory management and data transfer between the host and the GPU.
Also, this code uses the float data type, but you can modify it to use double or other data types as needed.

Note: This code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to CUDA but allows for cross-platform portability between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The hipLaunchKernel function launches the GEMVKernel kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU.
Also, note that this is a simplified version of the code, you may want to add error checking and other features depending on your specific use case.

  }
}
Note: This code uses the HIP runtime API, which is similar to CUDA but allows for cross-platform portability between NVIDIA and AMD devices.
Also, the GEMVKernel is launched with a single block of n threads, where each thread handles one row of the matrix. The matrix A is assumed to be stored in row-major order.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a GPU device that supports HIP.


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);

}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {

    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is implemented in the GEMVKernel function, which is executed in parallel by multiple threads on the GPU. Each thread computes a single element of the output vector y.
Also, note that the matrix A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, and the array x and y are assumed to be stored in contiguous memory.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
You can also use the hipify tool to convert the OpenACC code to HIP code, it will generate the same code as above.
