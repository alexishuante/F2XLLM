Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C, and integer corresponds to int. Also, the loop indices in C are 0-based, whereas in Fortran they are 1-based, so I've adjusted the indices accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma acc parallel loop to specify the parallel loop, and copyin and copyout clauses to specify the data that needs to be copied between host and device, just like in the Fortran code.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI suite, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC for the SpMV operation:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices have been adjusted accordingly. Also, the default(present) clause in the Fortran OpenACC directive is not needed in C, as the compiler can automatically determine which variables to copy based on their usage in the parallel region.
To compile the C code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as pgcc (Portland Group C Compiler) or nvcc (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) with the appropriate flags to enable OpenACC support. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -Minfo=accel spmv_parallel.c
This will compile the code and generate a CUDA kernel for the parallel region. The -Minfo=accel flag tells the compiler to display information about the acceleration of the parallel region.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C. If you're using double precision in Fortran, you should use double in C.
Also, the DEFAULT(PRESENT) clause in the Fortran code is not necessary in C, as the copyin and copyout clauses will automatically handle the data transfer.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI suite, using the -acc flag:
pgcc -acc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable that can run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If your application uses float precision, you can simply replace double with float in the function signature and body.
Also, I've used the present clause to ensure that the arrays val, row, col, and x are present on the accelerator device, and the copyout clause to copy the result array y back to the host.
You can compile this function with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag, and link it with the appropriate libraries to use the OpenACC runtime.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is common in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the type accordingly.
Also, I've used the present clause to ensure that the arrays val, row, col, and x are present on the GPU, and the copyout clause to copy the result array y back to the host.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If you need to use a different precision (e.g., float or long double), you can modify the type of val, x, and y accordingly.
Also, I've used the #pragma acc parallel loop directive to specify the parallel loop, and the copyin and copyout clauses to specify the data that needs to be copied between the host and device. The default(present) clause is not needed in C, as the compiler can automatically detect the presence of the openacc directive.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler (such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag) and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive tells the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be used as a fallback for devices that don't support parallel execution.
To compile this code, you'll need to use an OpenACC-enabled compiler like pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag. For example:
pgcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC for the SpMV operation:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the routine is a sequential kernel, which is equivalent to the Fortran !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive.
To compile this code, you'll need to use an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as the PGI compiler or GCC with the OpenACC plugin. The compilation command would be something like:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -c spmv_parallel.c
This will generate a CUDA kernel that can be executed on an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC for the SpMV operation:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices have been adjusted accordingly. Also, the default(present) clause in the Fortran code is not needed in C, as the compiler can automatically determine which variables to copy based on their usage in the parallel region.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copyout(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, I've used #pragma acc parallel loop instead of !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP which is the syntax for OpenACC in C.
To compile, you can use a command like:
gcc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c -lopenacc
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.
