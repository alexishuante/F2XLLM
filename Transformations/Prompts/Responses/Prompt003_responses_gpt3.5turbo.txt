Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP for parallelization:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, `n` is the size of the matrix and vectors, `A` is the matrix stored row-wise in a 1D array, `x` is the input vector, and `y` is the output vector. The function parallelizes the computation of the GEMV operation using OpenMP directives.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:
```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
``` 

In this C function, we use `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop in a similar way to the Fortran OpenMP implementation. The parallelization is achieved by distributing the loop iterations among the available threads. The private variables `sum` and `j` are declared within the loop to ensure thread safety and prevent data races.

Note that the memory layout in the C version may be different due to row-major vs. column-major differences in array storage between Fortran and C. In the C code, matrix `A` is treated as a 1D array with row-major ordering.

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j,sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, we use OpenMP directives to parallelize the loop that performs the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation. The `private(j,sum)` clause is used to declare private variables `j` and `sum` for each thread in the parallel region.

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[3][3] = {
        {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
        {4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
        {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}
    };
    float x[3] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    float y[3];
    
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    
    printf("Result:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This C function performs the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation using OpenMP parallelization. The `gemv_parallel` function takes in the size `n`, the matrix `A`, the vector `x`, and outputs the result vector `y`. The code includes parallelization using the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to distribute the work across multiple threads.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
``` 

This C function performs the same Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation as the Fortran subroutine, utilizing OpenMP directives to parallelize the outer loop iteration across multiple threads.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP for the above Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` directive in Fortran.

Output 7:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenMP that corresponds to the Fortran subroutine you provided for Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma omp parallel for private(j)` directive has been used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` and privateize the loop index `j` and the `sum` variable within each thread. This achieves parallel execution of the GEMV operation using OpenMP in a similar manner to the Fortran implementation.

Output 8:
Here is the C function implemented with OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine that computes a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for(j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenMP to parallelize the computation of the GEMV operation in a similar way as the Fortran subroutine. Note that in C, the matrix `A` is represented as a 1D array with row-major ordering, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this function, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop over `i` using OpenMP, distributing the work among multiple threads for faster execution.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C implementation, the function `gemv_parallel` performs a generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation in parallel using OpenMP. The input matrices `A` and `x` are represented as 1D arrays with the elements stored in row-major order. The result is stored in the output array `y`.

You can call this function in your C code to perform a GEMV operation in parallel using OpenMP.
