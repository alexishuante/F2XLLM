Output 1:
Here are the equivalent functions in C with OpenMP and OpenACC:
Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) in C with OpenMP
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
AXPY operation in C with OpenACC
void saxpy_parallel(int n, double a, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in the OpenACC version, I used the present clause to ensure that the arrays x and y are present on the accelerator device. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses in the OpenMP version.
Also, I used double as the data type for the arrays, assuming that's what you want. If you need to use a different data type, just replace double with the appropriate type.


Output 2:
Here are the equivalent functions in C with OpenMP and OpenACC:
Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
AXPY with OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void saxpy_parallel(int n, double a, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(x, y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that in the OpenACC version of the AXPY function, I've used the present clause to ensure that the arrays x and y are present on the device. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses in the OpenMP version.
Also, in the OpenMP version of the SpMV function, I've used the default(none) clause to specify that no variables are shared by default, and then explicitly listed the shared variables using the shared clause. This is a good practice to avoid accidental sharing of variables.

AXPY with OpenACC:

  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(x) copyout(y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the copyin and copyout clauses in OpenACC are used to specify the data that needs to be transferred between the host and device memories.

Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the OpenACC directive in the AXPY function is #pragma acc parallel loop, which is equivalent to the OpenMP directive #pragma omp parallel do in the Fortran code.

Note that I assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed. Also, the int type is used for the indices and sizes, but you can change it to long or long long if you need to support larger matrices.

Note that in the OpenACC versions, I used copyin and copyout clauses to specify the data that needs to be transferred between the host and device. This is because OpenACC uses a separate memory space for the device, whereas OpenMP uses a shared memory space.

  }
}
Note that in the OpenACC versions, I used copyin and copyout clauses to specify the data that needs to be transferred between host and device, similar to the COPYIN and COPYOUT directives in the Fortran code. Also, I assumed that the double type is the appropriate type for the floating-point numbers, but you can adjust this according to your specific use case.

Note that in the OpenACC versions, I used copyin and copyout clauses to specify the data that needs to be transferred between the host and device. In the OpenMP versions, I relied on the default behavior of sharing the data between threads.
