Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the index calculation A[i * n + j] is used to access the element at row i and column j.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, and the private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.
You can also use std::vector and std::valarray to make the code more modern and safe:
#include <vector>
#include <valarray>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const std::vector<float>& A, const std::valarray<float>& x, std::valarray<float>& y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
This version is more secure, as it uses bounds checking and prevents data races.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is adjusted accordingly.
To compile and run this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC or Clang. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
This code will execute the GEMV operation in parallel using OpenMP threads. The private(sum) clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, avoiding race conditions.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, whereas in Fortran, they are 1-indexed by default. Also, in C/C++, we need to explicitly calculate the index in a 2D array, whereas in Fortran, this is handled automatically.

        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.

To compile this code, you would need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, and link with the OpenMP library. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on your system.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenACC code:
void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and array indices are zero-based. Also, the matrix A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, which is the default in C/C++. The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop.
