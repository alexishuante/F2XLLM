--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as Fortran's real type is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used double **A to represent the 2D array A, as C does not have built-in support for 2D arrays. The private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own copy of the i and sum variables.
Keep in mind that this code assumes that the input matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your Fortran code uses column-major order, you may need to adjust the indexing accordingly.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, and **A to represent the 2D array A. Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and private(i, sum) to ensure each thread has its own copy of i and sum.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed that the input matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if you need double precision arithmetic.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed the matrices and vectors are represented as 1D arrays, with the matrix A stored in row-major order (i.e., each row is contiguous in memory). This is a common convention in C.
Also, I've used float instead of real since C does not have a built-in real type. If you want to use double precision, you can replace float with double.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the outer loop, dividing the iterations among the available threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations, and the results will be combined at the end.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, the private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, to avoid race conditions.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to pass the size of the array as a parameter, and we use pointers to arrays (e.g., double **A) instead of 2D arrays (e.g., real, intent(in) :: A(n, n)). Additionally, the loop indices in C start at 0, not 1.
Also, the private(i, sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the variables i and sum, which is equivalent to the implicit private status of these variables in the Fortran subroutine.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the matrix and vectors, but you can easily change it to double if needed. Also, the matrix A is assumed to be a 2D array of pointers to float, which is a common way to represent matrices in C.
Keep in mind that OpenMP and OpenACC have different syntax and semantics, so the translation is not always one-to-one. However, this C function should perform the same operation as the original Fortran subroutine.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as Fortran's real type is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used double **A to represent the 2D array A, as C doesn't have built-in support for 2D arrays like Fortran does.
The OpenMP directive #pragma omp parallel for is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the private clause specifies that each thread should have its own private copies of the variables i and sum.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the matrix and vectors, and changed the array indexing to C-style (0-based). Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and declared i and sum as private variables to ensure each thread has its own copy.
Please let me know if you need any further modifications!

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as it is the default in Fortran. Also, the **A syntax denotes a 2D array, where each row is a pointer to a double.
Keep in mind that OpenMP uses the #pragma directive to specify parallel regions and loop directives, whereas OpenACC uses !$ACC directives. The private clause in OpenMP ensures that each thread has its own copy of the variables i and sum.
