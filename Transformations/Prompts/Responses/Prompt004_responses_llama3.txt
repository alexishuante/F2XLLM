Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)

            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to ensure that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can call this function like this:

    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP support, e.g. gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran using OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop counters start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, so the indexing is done as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, which is equivalent to the !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in OpenACC.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran.
Also, I used double as the type for the arrays, but you can change it to float if you need single precision.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code uses the malloc function to allocate memory for the arrays A, x, and y, and then calls the gemv_parallel function to perform the matrix-vector multiplication. Finally, it frees the memory using free.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed that the arrays are double precision, if you are using single precision you can change double to float.
You can call this function in your main program, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000; // size of the matrix
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
You need to compile your program with OpenMP flag, for example with GCC:
gcc -fopenmp your_program.c -o your_program
This will enable the parallelization of the GEMV operation using OpenMP.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrix A. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, I used float as the data type, if you want to use double precision, you can change it to double and also change the float literals to double literals (e.g. 0.0 to 0.0e0)
Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed that the real type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. If your Fortran code uses single precision reals (i.e., real*4), you should use float instead of double in the C code.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed double precision for the floating point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed.
You can compile and run this code using OpenMP with a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
This will parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP, and each thread will compute a portion of the output vector y.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, which is necessary to avoid race conditions.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel <n> <A_file> <x_file> <y_file>
Assuming you have the matrix A and vector x stored in files A_file and x_file, respectively, and you want to store the result in file y_file.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports it, such as GCC:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And run it using:
./gemv_parallel
You can also use the omp_get_max_threads() function to get the maximum number of threads that can be used, and the omp_get_thread_num() function to get the current thread number, if you need to fine-tune the parallelization.
