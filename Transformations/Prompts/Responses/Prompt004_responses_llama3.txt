Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to manually calculate the index in the array A using i * n + j. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to make each thread have its own copy of the sum variable.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
You can compile this code with:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And run it with:
./gemv_parallel
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(const int n, const double *A, const double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I've used double as the data type, but you can change it to float if you need single precision.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports it, such as GCC:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And then run it with the desired number of threads using the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./gemv_parallel
This will execute the GEMV operation in parallel using 4 threads.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to perform the indexing calculations manually. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to ensure that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
Assuming your compiler supports OpenMP.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and 2D arrays are represented as 1D arrays with manual indexing. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can compile and run this code using:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
./gemv_parallel
Assuming the code is in a file called gemv_parallel.c.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to perform the index calculation manually (A[i * n + j]). Also, the private clause is used to ensure each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code uses the malloc function to allocate memory for the matrices and vectors, and the free function to deallocate the memory when it's no longer needed.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {

        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I've used double as the data type, assuming that's what you want. If you need to use a different type, just replace double with the appropriate type.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran.
Also, the private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, to avoid race conditions.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    double *A = malloc(n * n * sizeof(double));
    double *x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));
    double *y = malloc(n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize A and x

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Use the result in y

    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, I assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can change it to float if needed.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as Fortran's real type is typically equivalent to double in C. Also, the **A syntax denotes a 2D array, where each row is a pointer to a double.
Please let me know if you need further modifications!
