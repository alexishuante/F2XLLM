--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the matrix and vectors, but you can easily modify it to double if needed. Also, I've used the private clause to ensure each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.
Keep in mind that the Fortran code uses column-major ordering, while the C code uses row-major ordering. This means the memory layout of the matrix A will be transposed between the two languages.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMV operation in C with OpenMP:
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of the matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) as in Fortran.
Also, the private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on your system.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the float **A syntax assumes a 2D array is passed as a pointer to pointers. If your array is allocated as a 1D array, you may need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, keep in mind that OpenMP uses the private clause to specify variables that should have separate instances in each thread, which is similar to the !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP directive in OpenACC.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the matrix and vectors, and used float **A to represent a 2D array. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and private(i, j, sum) to ensure each thread has its own copy of the variables.
Please let me know if you need any further modifications!

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, and **A represents a 2D array. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
Please let me know if you need further modifications!

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the matrix and vectors, but you can easily change it to double if needed. Also, the float **A notation assumes a 2D array represented as a pointer to pointers, which is a common way to represent matrices in C.
Please note that OpenMP and OpenACC have different syntax and programming models, so the translation is not always one-to-one. However, this C version should achieve the same parallelization as the original Fortran code.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as it's more common in C. Also, I've used double **A to represent the 2D array, as it's more natural in C. If you want to use a 1D array to represent the matrix, you'll need to modify the indexing accordingly.
Also, note that I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and private(sum) to ensure each thread has its own copy of the sum variable.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as it's the default in Fortran. Also, the double **A notation is used to represent a 2D array, where each row is a pointer to a double value.
In OpenMP, the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the private clause is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copies of the i and sum variables.
Keep in mind that this is a straightforward translation, and you may want to optimize the memory access patterns or data structures for better performance in your specific use case.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran.
Also, the private(sum) clause in the OpenMP directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable, to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler like GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
And then run it with the desired number of threads using the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, for example:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
./gemv_parallel
This will execute the GEMV operation in parallel using 4 threads.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double **A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, and **A to represent the 2D array A. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, unlike Fortran where they start from 1.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and private(sum) to ensure each thread has its own private copy of the sum variable.
