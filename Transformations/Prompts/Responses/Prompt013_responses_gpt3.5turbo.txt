--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Sure! Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that performs the same Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation as the provided Fortran subroutine implemented with OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[], float x[], float y[]) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenACC directives to parallelize the matrix-vector multiplication operation on the GPU. The `present` clause ensures that the data referenced in the arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` is available on the device. The `acc parallel loop` directive distributes the iterations of the outer loop across the GPU threads, allowing for parallel execution of the GEMV operation.

You can call this `gemv_parallel` function in your C program to perform the GEMV operation in parallel using OpenACC.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is a C function implemented with OpenACC that computes a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation, equivalent to the Fortran subroutine provided:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function uses OpenACC directives to parallelize the computation of the GEMV operation. The `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive instructs the compiler to parallelize the loop over `i`, distributing the computation across available parallel processing units. The function takes pointers to the input matrices `A` and `x`, and the output vector `y`, along with the size `n` of the matrices. The computation inside the loop is similar to the Fortran subroutine, with the calculated values stored in the output vector `y`.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is a similar function implemented in C with OpenACC that performs the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc data copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    {
        #pragma acc parallel loop collapse(2) private(sum)
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum = 0.0;
            for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
            }
            y[i] = sum;
        }
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `acc data` directive is used to copy the input and output arrays to/from the GPU memory. The `acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop of the GEMV operation across the GPU threads. The `collapse(2)` clause is used to collapse the nested loops into a single loop for better optimization. The `private(sum)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the `sum` variable to avoid race conditions.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC for the provided Fortran subroutine that computes a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In the C function above, we use OpenACC `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the outer loop. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses are used to specify the data movement between the host and device. This function should achieve parallel execution of the GEMV operation on the GPU using OpenACC.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is a function implemented in C with OpenACC that performs a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation, based on the given Fortran subroutine with OpenMP:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n],x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In the C function above, we use the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive to parallelize the outer loop that iterates over the rows of matrix A and the corresponding elements of vector x to compute the elements of the output vector y. The `present()` clause ensures that the data is available on the accelerator device, and the `copyout()` clause specifies that the output vector y should be copied back to the host after the computation.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i` using OpenACC. The loop will be automatically parallelized across the available GPU cores, enabling efficient parallel execution of the GEMV operation.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

This C function utilizes OpenACC directives to parallelize the computation of the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation in a similar way to the Fortran subroutine using OpenMP directives.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is the equivalent C function implemented with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y)
{
    #pragma acc parallel loop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        float sum = 0.0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }

        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop of the matrix-vector multiplication operation using OpenACC. The `n` parameter specifies the size of the square matrix `A` and the vectors `x` and `y`. The matrix `A` is stored in row-major order as a 1D array, so the index calculation `i*n + j` is used to access the elements of `A`.

This C function can be called in a C program to perform the generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation in parallel using OpenACC.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:

```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(A[0:n*n], x[0:n]) copyout(y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this C function, the `#pragma acc parallel loop` directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenACC directives. The `copyin` and `copyout` clauses are used to specify the data movement between the host and device.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
```c
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma acc parallel loop present(A[0:n*n], x[0:n], y[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i*n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```
