Output 1:
Certainly! The given Fortran subroutine for a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP can be translated to a similar C function using OpenMP. Below, I provide the equivalent C function:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Function Arguments:**
  - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
  - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars as in the GEMM operation.
  - `a`, `b`, `c`: Pointers to the matrices in row-major order.
  - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).

- **OpenMP Directive:**
  - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallels the outermost loop (over `j`), and `private` specifies that loop variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are private to each thread.
  - `schedule(static)` breaks the loop iterations into contiguous chunks, which are then distributed to the threads.

- **Matrix Access:**
  - For matrix `a[i, l]`, the index in row-major order is `a[i * lda + l]`.
  - For matrix `b[l, j]`, the index in row-major order is `b[l * ldb + j]`.
  - For matrix `c[i, j]`, the index in row-major order is `c[i * ldc + j]`.

This code assumes you have the proper environment setup and a C compiler that supports OpenMP (like `gcc` with the `-fopenmp` flag).

### Example Compilation:
You can compile this C code with OpenMP support using gcc:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

You can then call the `gemm_parallel` function from your main C program or other routines as needed. Make sure the leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`) and other parameters are provided correctly to ensure the function operates as expected.

Output 2:
Here is a C implementation of the provided Fortran subroutine that performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenMP for parallelism. Note that in C, array indexing starts at 0, unlike Fortran, which starts at 1.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 2, n = 3, k = 4;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;

    double a[8] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
                   5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0};

    double b[12] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
                    4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
                    7.0, 8.0, 9.0,
                    10.0, 11.0, 12.0};

    double c[6] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 
                   0.0, 0.0, 0.0};
                   
    int lda = 4;
    int ldb = 3;
    int ldc = 3;

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);

    // Print result matrix c
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * ldc + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:** The function `gemm_parallel` handles the Generalized Matrix Multiplication. 
2. **Parallelism:** The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive ensures parallel execution of the outer loop. Variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` are declared `private` so each thread works with its own instances of these variables.
3. **Array Indexing:** The arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are accessed using row-major order indexing, which is typical in C.
4. **Main Function:** An example is provided, initializing `a`, `b`, and `c` matrices along with their dimensions and scalar multipliers `alpha` and `beta`. The function `gemm_parallel` is called, and the result is printed.

### Compilation:
To compile this program with OpenMP support, you can use a command like:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

### Execution:
Run the executable:
```sh
./gemm_parallel
```

Output 3:
Sure, here is the equivalent implementation of the provided Fortran subroutine in C using OpenMP for parallelization. This function performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) schedule(static) private(j, i, l) 
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (int l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Here is a breakdown of the translation process:
1. The arguments and their intent are preserved. We switch from Fortran's column-major order to C's row-major order in memory access patterns.
2. The loop indices (i, j, l) are defined inside the parallel region and marked as private.
3. The `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) schedule(static)` directive is used to parallelize the outer loops (j and i).
4. Memory indexing is directly translated from Fortran's 1-based index to C's 0-based index.

Make sure you have OpenMP enabled when compiling this C code. For example, you can compile with `gcc` using the `-fopenmp` flag, like so:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm_parallel.c
```

Also, remember that in C, arrays are zero-based, while in Fortran they are one-based, which is reflected in the loop ranges. Always ensure this when performing such translations.

Output 4:
Sure! Here's a C function that computes the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP, corresponding to the provided Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l) schedule(static) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            double temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parameter Types:**
   - `m`, `n`, `k` are integers representing the dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta` are scalars of type `double`.
   - `a`, `b`, `c` are pointers to arrays (representing matrices) of type `double`.
   - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc` are leading dimensions of the respective matrices.

2. **Matrix Access:**
    In Fortran, arrays are stored in column-major order. In C, arrays are stored in row-major order. To ensure we access the elements similarly in both languages, we use the formula `index = row * leading_dimension + column`.

3. **OpenMP Directive:**
   `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loops with a static schedule, and `collapse(2)` is used to collapse the first two loops (for `i` and `j`), turning them into a single loop for parallel execution.

4. **Temp Variable Calculation:**
   The inner loop calculates the dot product of the `i-th` row of matrix `a` and the `j-th` column of matrix `b` and accumulates the result in the `temp` variable.

5. **Matrix Update:**
   The result is then scaled by `alpha` and added to the `c(i, j)` element, which is also scaled by `beta`.

### Usage:
To use the function, you need to have matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` initialized, along with respective dimensions and scalar values. Make sure OpenMP is enabled in your compiler. For example, if using GCC, compile with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

This code provides a parallel implementation similar to the provided Fortran subroutine. Adjust the input matrices and dimensions appropriately based on your application's needs.

Output 5:
Certainly! Below is a C implementation of the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation that is parallelized using OpenMP. This function corresponds to the provided Fortran subroutine `gemm_parallel`.

### GEMM in C with OpenMP

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda,
                   double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i + l * lda] * b[l + j * ldb];
            }
            c[i + j * ldc] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i + j * ldc];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3;
    int n = 3;
    int k = 3;
    
    double alpha = 1.0;
    double beta = 1.0;
    
    double a[3*3] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
                     4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
                     7.0, 8.0, 9.0};
                     
    double b[3*3] = {9.0, 8.0, 7.0,
                     6.0, 5.0, 4.0,
                     3.0, 2.0, 1.0};
                     
    double c[3*3] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
                     1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
                     1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
    
    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, 3, b, 3, beta, c, 3);
    
    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
            printf("%lf ", c[i + j * 3]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Function Parameters**:
    - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
    - `alpha` and `beta`: Scalars used in the computation.
    - `a`, `b`, `c`: Matrices involved in the GEMM operation. They should be provided as 1D arrays in the column-major order.
    - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Computational Loop**:
    - The double loop structure for `j` and `i` simulates the two outer loops in the Fortran subroutine.
    - The innermost loop computes the dot product of the appropriate row of `a` and column of `b` and accumulates the result in `temp`.
    - Finally, the result is scaled by `alpha` and combined with the scaled value of `c`.

3. **OpenMP Pragmas**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static) collapse(2)`:
        - Parallelizes the outer two loops (`j` and `i`) with a static scheduling policy.
        - The `collapse(2)` clause ensures these two loops are collapsed into one larger loop for better workload distribution across threads.

4. **Column-Major Ordering**:
    - This implementation assumes the matrices are stored in column-major order, similar to Fortran. This ordering is crucial when accessing elements to ensure correctness and optimal memory access patterns.

This implementation should effectively parallelize the GEMM operation similar to the provided Fortran subroutine. Make sure to include the OpenMP library during compilation by adding the flag `-fopenmp` with GCC, for example:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_openmp gemm_openmp.c
```

Output 6:
Sure, here is an equivalent implementation of the `gemm_parallel` subroutine in C using OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, 
                   double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Parameters**:
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars to be used in the GEMM operation.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: Matrices involved in the GEMM operation.
   - `lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`: Leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Matrix Access**:
   - In Fortran, matrices are accessed column-major, whereas in C they are accessed row-major. Thus, specific care is required in accessing elements while converting.

3. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive provides parallelization, and the `static` schedule clause ensures a simple distribution of iterations across threads.

### Notes:
- **Matrix Layout**: In the code above, it is assumed that matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are stored in a 1D array layout (row-major) as typical in C. Adjust the index calculations if using different formats.
- **Performance Tuning**: Further optimizations can be made depending on the specific use case and hardware characteristics, such as different scheduling strategies or loop unrolling.

This function aims to provide a direct and clear conversion from the provided Fortran subroutine into equivalent C code with OpenMP to ensure parallel execution.

Output 7:
Sure, here is the equivalent C function for performing a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP. The function is based on the given Fortran subroutine.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 2, n = 2, k = 2;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
    double a[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};  // 2x2 matrix
    double b[4] = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0};  // 2x2 identity matrix
    double c[4] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};  // 2x2 matrix, initial values

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i * m + j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `gemm_parallel` function performs the GEMM operation:

  \[
  C = \alpha \cdot A \cdot B + \beta \cdot C
  \]

- `a` is the matrix \(A\), with leading dimension `lda`.
- `b` is the matrix \(B\), with leading dimension `ldb`.
- `c` is the matrix \(C\), with leading dimension `ldc`.
- `alpha` and `beta` are scalars.

- The OpenMP parallel construct `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop over `j`.

### Notes:

1. The Fortran array syntax uses 1-based indexing, whereas C uses 0-based indexing. Hence, looping in C starts from `0` instead of `1`.

2. Multidimensional arrays in Fortran are stored in column-major order, while C uses row-major order. This affects the indexing for accessing matrix elements, as depicted by `a[i * lda + l]` and `b[l * ldb + j]`.

3. The main function demonstrates an example usage of the `gemm_parallel` function. It initializes matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, calls the GEMM function, and then prints the resulting matrix `c`.

Output 8:
Sure, here's a C function using OpenMP that performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) similar to the provided Fortran code:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double** a, int lda, double** b, int ldb, double beta, double** c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i][l] * b[l][j];
            }
            c[i][j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Parameters**:
    - `m`: Number of rows in matrix `a` and `c`.
    - `n`: Number of columns in matrix `b` and `c`.
    - `k`: Number of columns in matrix `a` (which is also the number of rows in matrix `b`).
    - `alpha`: Scalar multiplier for the product of matrices `a` and `b`.
    - `a`: 2D array with dimensions `lda` x `k`.
    - `lda`: Leading dimension of array `a`.
    - `b`: 2D array with dimensions `ldb` x `n`.
    - `ldb`: Leading dimension of array `b`.
    - `beta`: Scalar multiplier for matrix `c`.
    - `c`: 2D array with dimensions `ldc` x `n`.
    - `ldc`: Leading dimension of array `c`.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
    - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop (over `j`).
    - `private` clause ensures each thread has its own copy of the private variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp`.
    - `schedule(static)` indicates the static distribution of loop iterations among threads.

### Notes:

1. **Array Indexing**:
   - In C, array indices start from `0` whereas in Fortran they start from `1`. Therefore, the loops run over `0` to `m-1`, `0` to `n-1`, and `0` to `k-1`.

2. **Matrix Representation**:
   - The matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are represented using double pointers `double**`. Make sure these matrices are allocated and deallocated properly in your main code to avoid memory leaks.
   - Ensure that the leading dimensions `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are correctly set according to your matrix dimensions.

3. **Performance**:
   - Optimizing matrix multiplication can be non-trivial. For improved performance, consider using optimized libraries like BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) which often leverage hardware-specific optimizations.

Remember to enable OpenMP during compilation, e.g., using `-fopenmp` for GCC:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o myprogram myprogram.c
```

This implementation should provide the desired functionality while taking advantage of OpenMP for parallelism.

Output 9:
Sure! Below is the equivalent C function that performs the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenMP. This follows the same logic and parallelism directives that are used in the provided Fortran subroutine.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Function Signature**: The function `gemm_parallel` takes similar parameters as the Fortran subroutine but following C conventions.
  - `m`, `n`, and `k` are the dimensions of the matrices.
  - `alpha` and `beta` are scalars that scale matrix multiplication and addition with matrix C, respectively.
  - `a`, `b`, and `c` are pointers to the matrices.
  - `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are the leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

- **OpenMP Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop (`j` loop). Private variables `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp` ensure that each thread maintains its own copy of these variables, avoiding race conditions.

- **Matrix Access**: Notice the conversion from Fortran 1-based indexing to C 0-based indexing and row-major order indexing:
  - `a[i * lda + l]`: Accesses element at row `i` and column `l` of matrix `a`.
  - `b[l * ldb + j]`: Accesses element at row `l` and column `j` of matrix `b`.
  - `c[i * ldc + j]`: Accesses element at row `i` and column `j` of matrix `c`.
  
This function parallelizes the GEMM computation using OpenMP in C, in a manner analogous to the OpenMP-parallel Fortran subroutine provided.

Output 10:
Certainly! Here's a C implementation of the given Fortran subroutine `gemm_parallel` which performs Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), adapted for use with OpenMP for parallelization:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

Remember to compile the code with the OpenMP flag enabled (e.g., `-fopenmp` for GCC) to enable OpenMP directives.

### Explanation:
1. **Parameters**:
    - `m`: Number of rows of `a` and `c`.
    - `n`: Number of columns of `b` and `c`.
    - `k`: Number of columns of `a` and number of rows of `b`.
    - `alpha`: Scalar multiplier for the product of matrices `a` and `b`.
    - `a`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `a` with dimensions `lda x k`.
    - `lda`: Leading dimension of matrix `a`.
    - `b`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `b` with dimensions `ldb x n`.
    - `ldb`: Leading dimension of matrix `b`.
    - `beta`: Scalar multiplier for the matrix `c`.
    - `c`: Pointer to the first element of matrix `c` with dimensions `ldc x n`.
    - `ldc`: Leading dimension of matrix `c`.

2. **Loops and OpenMP**:
    - The outer loop iterates over columns of `b` and `c` (j-loop).
    - The middle loop iterates over rows of `a` and `c` (i-loop).
    - The inner loop iterates over columns of `a` and rows of `b` for the dot product (l-loop).
    - OpenMP parallelization is applied to the outer loop using `#pragma omp parallel for`.

3. **Matrix Multiplication Logic**:
    - The innermost loop computes the dot product of the `i-th` row of `a` and `j-th` column of `b`.
    - The result is scaled by `alpha` and added to `beta` times the existing value in `c[i,j]`.

### Note:
For correct functioning of `gemm_parallel`, it should be ensured that:
- Matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are stored in a row-major format, which is typical for C arrays.
- The leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`) of the matrices are set correctly according to their respective storage and intended layout.

This implementation mimics the structure and behavior of the Fortran subroutine, utilizing OpenMP for parallel execution on multicore processors.
