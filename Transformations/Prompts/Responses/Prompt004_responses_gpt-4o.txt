Output 1:
Certainly! Below is the `gemv_parallel` subroutine implemented in C with OpenMP to perform a generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y) 
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j]; // Assumes A is stored in row-major order
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 3; // Example size
    float A[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 
                 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 
                 7.0, 8.0, 9.0}; // Example matrix stored in row-major order
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};   // Example vector
    float y[3];                    // Output vector

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Details:
- **Headers**: Includes the `omp.h` header for using OpenMP functionalities.
- **Function**: The function `gemv_parallel` takes the size of the matrix `n`, pointers to the matrix `A` (assumed to be in row-major order), the input vector `x`, and the output vector `y`.
- **Parallel Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over rows `i`. 
- **Private and Shared Variables**: The `private(i, j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of `i` and `j`, while `shared(A, x, y)` allows threads to access the shared data.
- **Matrix Access**: Matrix `A` is accessed using `A[i * n + j]` to accommodate row-major storage in C.

This C code with OpenMP will parallelize the matrix-vector multiplication by distributing the rows across multiple threads, making use of potentially multiple CPU cores.

Output 2:
To translate your Fortran subroutine that uses OpenACC for parallelism into a C function that uses OpenMP for parallelism, you can follow a straightforward approach. Here's how you can implement the Generalized Matrix-Vector multiplication (GEMV) operation in C with OpenMP:

### Fortran subroutine (for reference)

```fortran
subroutine gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real, intent(in) :: A(n, n)
    real, intent(in) :: x(n)
    real, intent(out) :: y(n)
    integer :: i, j
    real :: sum
    !$ACC PARALLEL LOOP
    do i = 1, n
        sum = 0.0
        do j = 1, n
            sum = sum + A(i, j) * x(j)
        end do
        y(i) = sum
    end do
    !$ACC END PARALLEL LOOP
end subroutine gemv_parallel
```

### C function with OpenMP
Here is the corresponding C function with OpenMP directives:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    
    // Parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- **Header and Function Signature**: The function `gemv_parallel` accepts the matrix `A`, the vector `x`, and outputs the vector `y`. Note that `A` is presented as a 1D array for compatibility with C.
- **OpenMP Directive**: `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i`.
- **Matrix Access**: Since C does not have multi-dimensional arrays in the normal sense, `A` is treated as a flattened array, hence `A[i * n + j]` is used to access the element at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column.
- **Private and Shared Clauses**: The variables `i` and `j` are made private to each thread, while `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among threads.

### Usage Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float *A, const float *x, float *y);

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[9] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; // 3x3 Matrix
    float x[3] = {1, 2, 3}; // Vector
    float y[3]; // Result Vector

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this C program, you need to ensure your compiler supports OpenMP, e.g., GCC. You can compile the program as follows:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c
./gemv
```

This will compute the matrix-vector multiplication in parallel and output the result. Make sure to run it in an environment with OpenMP support for parallel execution.

Output 3:
Certainly! Below is a C implementation of the Generalized Matrix-Vector (GEMV) operation using OpenMP for parallelization.

### C Implementation with OpenMP

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    // Parallelize outer loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

// Helper function to print the vector
void print_vector(float *vec, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", vec[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    float x[] = {1, 1, 1};
    float y[3];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    printf("Result vector y:\n");
    print_vector(y, n);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **gemv_parallel Function**:
   - The `gemv_parallel` function takes in the size of the matrix/vector `n`, pointers to the matrix `A`, and vectors `x` and `y`.
   - The matrix `A` is expected in row-major order as a 1D array to simplify passing it as a pointer.
   - We utilize `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop, which iterates over the rows of the matrix `A`.
   - Within the outer loop, a local variable `sum` is used to accumulate the dot product of the i-th row of `A` and vector `x`.
   - We then store the result in the i-th element of the output vector `y`.

2. **Matrix and Vector Storage**:
   - The matrix `A` is stored in row-major order in a 1D array. For example, the matrix:
     ```
     1 2 3
     4 5 6
     7 8 9
     ```
     is stored as `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

3. **main Function**:
   - A simple example is provided in the `main` function to demonstrate the use of `gemv_parallel`.
   - The matrix `A` and vector `x` are defined with some sample values, and the result is stored in vector `y`.
   - The `print_vector` helper function is used to print the resulting vector.

To compile this code with OpenMP, you need to use appropriate compiler flags. For example, with GCC, you can use:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

After compiling, you can run the executable to see the result of the generalized matrix-vector multiplication.

Output 4:
Sure, I can provide you with a C version of the specified subroutine that uses OpenMP for parallelism. The code below demonstrates a generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) using OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4; // Example size
    float A[16] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 
                   5, 6, 7, 8, 
                   9, 10, 11, 12,
                   13, 14, 15, 16};
    float x[4] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    
    // Print result for verification
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Header Inclusions**:
  - `#include <stdio.h>`: for input/output functions.
  - `#include <omp.h>`: for OpenMP functions and pragmas.
  
- **Function Implementation** `gemv_parallel`:
  - `int n`: the dimension of the matrix and vectors.
  - `float *A`: pointer to the first element of a column-major order 2D array representing the matrix.
  - `float *x`: pointer to the first element of the vector `x`.
  - `float *y`: pointer to the first element of the output vector `y`.
  - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over the rows of the matrix.
  - The sum variable is computed in a private manner for each thread to avoid race conditions.
  
- **Main Function**:
  - A simple main function is provided to demonstrate the use of `gemv_parallel`.
  - For simplicity, it uses a 4x4 matrix and vector of size 4.
  
#### Important Notes:
1. **Matrix Storage**: This implementation assumes the matrix is stored in row-major format (each row is stored one after another in memory). If you use column-major format (like in Fortran), you'll need to adjust indexing.
2. **OpenMP**: You need to compile with an OpenMP supporting compiler flag, typically `-fopenmp` with GCC.
   
```sh
gcc -fopenmp your_program.c -o your_program
```
3. **Array Indexing**: C uses 0-based indexing, which differs from Fortran's 1-based indexing. Adjustments are made accordingly in the example.

The implementation provided ensures parallel computation over matrix rows, which is similar to the action of the provided Fortran code utilizing OpenACC.

Output 5:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function using OpenMP to parallelize the computation of the Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV). OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the outer loop.

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4; // Example size of the matrix and vectors

    // Dynamically allocate memory for the matrix and vectors
    float **A = (float **)malloc(n * sizeof(float *));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    }
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize matrix A and vector x
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            A[i][j] = (float)(i + j); // Example initialization
        }
        x[i] = (float)i; // Example initialization
    }

    // Perform GEMV operation
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print result
    printf("Resulting vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);
    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** The matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y` are allocated dynamically, which ensures compatibility with various matrix sizes.
- **Parallelization:** The outer loop over `i` is parallelized using the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. This allows different iterations of this loop to run concurrently on different threads.
- **Private and Shared Variables:** The `private(i, j)` clause specifies that each thread has its own instance of `i` and `j`. The `shared(A, x, y)` clause ensures that these arrays are shared among threads, which is important for read-only access (`A`, `x`) and storing results (`y`).

### Compilation:
To compile the above code with OpenMP support, you can use the following command with `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c
```

### Execution:
You can then execute the compiled program to see the results of the GEMV operation.

Remember to adjust the size `n` and initial values of the matrix and vectors as needed for your specific application!

Output 6:
To rewrite the given Fortran subroutine using C and OpenMP for parallelization, we can leverage OpenMP's parallel constructs to achieve similar parallelism. Here is an equivalent version in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    float A[4][4] = { {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0},
                      {5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0},
                      {9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0},
                      {13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0} };
    float x[4] = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 };
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Header Inclusions**: `stdlib.h` and `stdio.h` are for general utilities and I/O operations, while `omp.h` is for OpenMP functionalities.
2. **Function Declaration**: `gemv_parallel` takes an integer `n`, a 2D array `A` (matrix), a 1D array `x` (vector), and a 1D array `y` (result vector).
3. **Parallelization**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outer loop. The `private(i, j, sum)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of these variables.
   - The `shared(A, x, y)` clause specifies that these arrays are shared among all threads.
4. **Computation**:
   - The nested loops perform the GEMV computation, with each element of `y` calculated as the dot product of a row of `A` with the vector `x`.
5. **Main Function**:
   - Initializes a sample 4x4 matrix `A` and vector `x`.
   - Calls `gemv_parallel` to compute the matrix-vector product and stores the result in `y`.
   - Prints the resulting vector `y`.

This C/OpenMP version efficiently utilizes parallel computing capabilities to perform the generalized matrix-vector multiplication operation similarly to the provided Fortran/OpenACC subroutine.

Output 7:
Sure, I can provide you with an equivalent function written in C using OpenMP to perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation. Here it is:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Directive `#pragma omp parallel for`:** This is the OpenMP directive that tells the compiler to parallelize the following for loop.  
2. **Clauses:**
   - `private(i, j, sum)`: Declares variables `i`, `j`, and `sum` to be private to each thread. Each thread gets its private copy of these variables.
   - `shared(A, x, y)`: Declares variables `A`, `x`, and `y` to be shared among all threads. All threads will have access to these shared copies.
3. **Matrix Storage:** In C, matrices are stored in row-major order, meaning `A[i * n + j]` is the (i, j)th element of the matrix `A`.

### Usage example:
Here's an example of how you can call the `gemv_parallel` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y);

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    float A[] = {
        1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
        5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0,
        9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0,
        13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0
    };
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation:
To compile with OpenMP, you should use the `-fopenmp` flag (for GCC):

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

Then you can run the executable `./gemv_parallel`. This example will perform the matrix-vector multiplication and print the resulting vector.

Output 8:
To translate the Fortran subroutine using OpenACC for a generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) to C using OpenMP, I'll write a function named `gemv_parallel` in C. Below is the equivalent C implementation using OpenMP directives for parallelism:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV)
void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Header Include**: `#include <omp.h>` to include the OpenMP library.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `gemv_parallel` takes four parameters: 
     - `n`: the size of the matrix and vectors.
     - `A`: the input matrix with size `n x n`.
     - `x`: the input vector with size `n`.
     - `y`: the output vector with size `n`.

3. **OpenMP Parallel Directive**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)`: This directive is used to parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP.
     - `private(i, j)` specifies that each thread has its own private copy of the loop indices `i` and `j`.
     - `shared(A, x, y)` specifies that the matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y` are shared among all threads.

4. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:
   - The outer loop iterates over rows of the matrix `A`.
   - For each row `i`, it initializes `sum` to 0.0.
   - The inner loop iterates over columns of the matrix `A` and performs the multiplication and accumulation to compute the dot product of row `i` and the vector `x`.
   - The result `sum` is stored in the output vector `y` at index `i`.

This function will now parallelize the GEMV operation using OpenMP, making use of multithreading to improve performance on multi-core processors.

Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C using OpenMP to perform a Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float A[n][n], const float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    const float A[3][3] = { {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 
                            {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, 
                            {7.0, 8.0, 9.0} };
    const float x[3] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
    float y[3];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this C code:
- The `gemv_parallel` function is implemented to carry out the matrix-vector multiplication in parallel using OpenMP.
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, which divides the iterations among the threads.
- The computation for each element `y[i]` of the vector `y` is performed in parallel.
- The `private(i, j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of the loop indices `i` and `j`.

Compile the code with a C compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC, using the `-fopenmp` flag:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

Run the executable:
```sh
./gemv_parallel
```

This will compute the matrix-vector product and print the resulting vector `y`.

Output 10:
You can translate the given Fortran subroutine using OpenACC to a similar C version using OpenMP. Below is a C implementation of the Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float **A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

Note: 
1. Ensure that you compile with OpenMP support, typically by using `-fopenmp` if you're using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc your_program.c -o your_program -fopenmp
```

2. For simplicity, this example uses dynamic memory allocation for the 2D array `A`. You need to ensure that the memory allocation succeeds in a production setting (by checking if pointers returned by `malloc` are not `NULL`).

3. In OpenMP, the directive `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the loop. The `private` clause makes `i`, `j`, and `sum` private to each thread, while `shared` ensures all threads see the same `A`, `x`, and `y`.
