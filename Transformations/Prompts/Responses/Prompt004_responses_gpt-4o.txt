Output 1:
Certainly! Below is a C function that performs a Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation, using OpenMP for parallelization. This function serves the equivalent purpose of the provided Fortran subroutine that uses OpenACC.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
#pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;

    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Header Files**: Includes `stdio.h` for standard I/O and `omp.h` for OpenMP functions and directives.
2. **Function `gemv_parallel`**:
    - Arguments: 
      - `n` (integer): the dimension of the matrix and vectors.
      - `A` (2D array of floats): the matrix.
      - `x` (array of floats): the input vector.
      - `y` (array of floats): the output vector.
    - The function uses `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the outer loop, which iterates over the rows of the matrix.
    - For each row `i`, it computes the dot product of the `i`-th row of `A` and vector `x` and stores the result in `y[i]`.
3. **`main` Function**:
    - Provides an example of how to use the `gemv_parallel` function.
    - Declares and initializes matrix `A` and vector `x`.
    - Calls `gemv_parallel` to compute the matrix-vector product and store the result in vector `y`.
    - Prints the resulting vector `y`.

This C implementation with OpenMP should provide functionality similar to the Fortran subroutine that uses OpenACC. To compile and run this code with OpenMP support, you can use a command like `gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c` and then run `./gemv`.

Output 2:
Certainly! The Fortran subroutine `gemv_parallel` you provided is performing a matrix-vector multiplication using OpenACC directives for parallelization. Here's the equivalent implementation in C using OpenMP for parallelization:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    // Parallelize the outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **OpenMP Directive**: 
    - `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to distribute the execution of the for loop iterations among the available threads.
    - `private(i, j, sum)` ensures that each thread has its own private copy of `i`, `j`, and `sum` variables.
    - `shared(A, x, y)` indicates that `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.

2. **Loop Indices**:
    - In C, array indices start from 0, so the loops range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Matrix and Vectors**:
    - The matrix `A` is referenced in C as `A[i][j]` and the vectors `x`, `y` as `x[j]` and `y[i]`.

This function should give you equivalent functionality to the Fortran subroutine while using OpenMP for parallelization. Make sure to compile the C code with an OpenMP-capable compiler (e.g., `gcc -fopenmp`).


Output 3:
Certainly! Here's a function implemented in C that uses OpenMP to perform a generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV). This function corresponds to the Fortran subroutine provided with OpenACC. 

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float** A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float* A[] = { (float[]) {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 
                   (float[]) {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, 
                   (float[]) {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}};
                   
    float x[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
    float y[n];
    
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    printf("Result y: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `gemv_parallel` accepts four parameters:
     - `n`: The size of the matrix and vectors.
     - `A`: A pointer to an array of pointers, representing the 2D matrix `A`.
     - `x`: A pointer to the input vector `x`.
     - `y`: A pointer to the output vector `y`.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)`:
     - This pragma tells the OpenMP runtime to parallelize the loop over `i`.
     - `private(i, j)` ensures that each thread has its own private copies of `i` and `j`.
     - `shared(A, x, y)` ensures that the matrix `A` and vectors `x`, `y` are shared among all threads.

3. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication Loop**:
   - The nested loop structure computes the matrix-vector product in a way that is similar to the Fortran example.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - The `main` function provides an example of how to use the `gemv_parallel` function.
   - It initializes a 3x3 matrix `A` and a vector `x`, and then calls `gemv_parallel` to compute the result in the vector `y`.
   
5. **Output**:
   - The result is printed out, demonstrating that the multiplication has been performed correctly.

This C implementation leverages OpenMP pragmas to parallelize the matrix-vector multiplication, similar to how the Fortran subroutine uses OpenACC for parallel execution.

Output 4:
Sure, here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP to perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4; // For demonstration, set the size of the matrix and vectors
    float A[16] = {1, 2, 3, 4,
                   5, 6, 7, 8,
                   9, 10, 11, 12,
                   13, 14, 15, 16};
    float x[4] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    
    // Print the result
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - `gemv_parallel` is the function equivalent to the Fortran subroutine.
   - `n` is the dimension of the N x N matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y`.
   - `A` is a pointer to the first element of the matrix `A` in row-major order.
   - `x` is a pointer to the vector `x`.
   - `y` is a pointer to the result vector `y`.

2. **OpenMP Parallel Directive**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)`:
     - `private(i, j)`: Makes the loop variables `i` and `j` private to each thread.
     - `shared(A, x, y)`: Specifies that `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.
   
3. **Loop Implementation**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix `A`.
   - The inner loop computes the dot product of the `i`-th row of `A` and the vector `x`, storing the result in `y[i]`.

4. **Main Function**:
   - Initialize the matrix `A` and vector `x`.
   - Call the `gemv_parallel` function to compute the GEMV operation.
   - Print the resulting vector `y`.

### Note:
In this implementation, the matrix `A` is stored in row-major order. If you have the matrix stored in column-major order, you need to modify the indexing accordingly.

Output 5:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP for parallelization. This function computes the Generalized Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) operation similar to the given Fortran subroutine with OpenACC.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **OpenMP Directive:** `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)` is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i`. The `private(i, j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of the loop variables `i` and `j`.
- **Inner Loop:** The inner loop sums up the products of the matrix row elements `A[i][j]` and vector elements `x[j]`, storing the result in the `sum` variable.
- **Assignment:** After completing the inner loop, the resulting sum is assigned to the corresponding element `y[i]` in the output vector `y`.

### Usage:
You can call `gemv_parallel` with your matrix `A`, input vector `x`, and an output vector `y` that will store the result after the computation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[3][3] = {
        {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
        {4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
        {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}
    };
    float x[3] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    float y[3] = {0};

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    printf("Resulting vector y:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This simple main program demonstrates how to initialize the matrix `A`, vector `x`, and calls `gemv_parallel` to compute the result. It then prints the computed vector `y`.

Ensure you compile your program with OpenMP support, e.g., using `gcc -fopenmp`.

Output 6:
Certainly! Below is an equivalent C function that performs the generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation, using OpenMP for parallelization.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Key Points of the C Implementation
- **Parallelization with OpenMP**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop where the index `i` runs from `0` to `n - 1`. This allows different iterations of the outer loop to be processed concurrently by different threads.
- **Private and Shared Clauses**: `private(i, j)` ensures each thread has its own private copies of `i` and `j`. `shared(A, x, y)` ensures `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among all threads.
- **Data Layout**: The matrix `A` is stored in row-major order as a 1D array. This means `A[i * n + j]` is used to access the element `A[i][j]`.

### Usage Example
Here is an example of how to use this function in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float* A, float* x, float* y);

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[] = {
        1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
        4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
        7.0, 8.0, 9.0
    };
    float x[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    float y[3];
    
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a 3x3 matrix `A`, a vector `x`, and calls the `gemv_parallel` function to compute the resulting vector `y`. Finally, it prints the elements of `y`.

Compile with OpenMP support:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

Remember to ensure your system has OpenMP support enabled. The `-fopenmp` flag is used for GCC to enable OpenMP.

Output 7:
To convert the given Fortran subroutine using OpenACC to a C function using OpenMP, we need to follow a relatively straightforward translation. Here's the C function that performs the same Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n]) {
    int i, j;

    // Parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Header:** `#include <omp.h>` to include OpenMP functionalities.
2. **Function Signature:** `void gemv_parallel(int n, float A[n][n], float x[n], float y[n])` adheres to C conventions, where arrays `A`, `x`, and `y` are passed along with their size `n`.
3. **Outer Loop Parallelization:** The `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)` directive parallelizes the outer loop. The `private(i, j)` clause ensures that each thread maintains its private copies of the `i` and `j` loop variables.
4. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication:** The inner loop calculates the dot product of each row of matrix `A` with vector `x`, storing the result in vector `y`.

This C function should be able to compile and run efficiently on systems with OpenMP support, allowing parallel execution to boost performance on multi-core processors.

Output 8:
Certainly! Below is a C function that implements the generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) using OpenMP for parallelization. The equivalent Fortran code provided used OpenACC, but in C we will use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive.

Here is the equivalent C code:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float* A, const float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float sum = 0.0f; // Thread-private variable
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j]; // Accessing the matrix A in row-major order
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;

    // Example matrix (4x4)
    float A[16] = {
        1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
        5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0,
        9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0,
        13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0
    };

    // Example vector
    float x[4] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};

    // Result vector
    float y[4];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Headers**: We include the `omp.h` header for OpenMP functionalities.
2. **gemv_parallel Function**:
    - The function signature takes the size `n`, the matrix `A` (in row-major order), the input vector `x`, and the output vector `y`.
    - We use the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to parallelize the outer loop.
    - Each thread will have private copies of the loop variables `i` and `j`, and a private `sum` variable.
    - We access the matrix `A` using row-major indexing (`A[i * n + j]`).

3. **Main Function**:
    - Initializes a 4x4 example matrix `A` and a vector `x`.
    - Calls the `gemv_parallel` function to compute `y = A * x`.
    - Prints the resulting vector `y`.

### Compiling and Running:

To compile this program with OpenMP support, use a modern C compiler with OpenMP flags.

For GCC:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
```

Then run the executable:
```sh
./gemv_parallel
```

This will compute the matrix-vector product and print the resulting vector `y`.

Output 9:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP to perform the Generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation as outlined in your Fortran subroutine with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, const float* A, const float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0f;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float A[] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
                 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
                 7.0, 8.0, 9.0};
    float x[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
    float y[3];

    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    printf("y = [");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%f ", y[i]);
    }
    printf("]\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function `gemv_parallel`**:
   - **Parameters**:
        - `n`: Size of the square matrix `A` and the vectors `x` and `y`.
        - `A`: Pointer to the first element of the matrix `A` stored in a 1D array (flattened 2D matrix).
        - `x`: Pointer to the first element of the input vector `x`.
        - `y`: Pointer to the first element of the output vector `y`.
   - **Parallel for loop**:
        - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i`.
        - Private clauses `private(i, j, sum)` ensure that each thread has its own private copy of `i`, `j`, and `sum`.

2. **Matrix Access**:
   - Matrix `A` is accessed using `A[i * n + j]`, adhering to row-major order where `i * n + j` converts 2D indices to 1D.

3. **Output**:
   - The results of the matrix-vector multiplication are stored in the vector `y`.

4. **Main function**:
   - Initializes a sample matrix `A` and vector `x`.
   - Calls `gemv_parallel` to compute the result.
   - Prints the result vector `y`.

Make sure you've included `<omp.h>` to utilize OpenMP directives and compile with the `-fopenmp` flag to enable OpenMP support, e.g., `gcc -fopenmp -o gemv gemv.c`.

Output 10:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function using OpenMP to perform the generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float** A, float* x, float* y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preprocessing Directives**:
    - `#include <omp.h>`: Includes the OpenMP library.

2. **Function Declaration**:
    - `void gemv_parallel(int n, float** A, float* x, float* y)`: Function signature with the matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y` as pointers.
  
3. **Parallel Region and Loop**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, sum) shared(A, x, y)`: This OpenMP pragma divides the iterations of the for loop among the available threads. The variables `i`, `j`, and `sum` are private to each thread (i.e., each thread has its own instance), and `A`, `x`, and `y` are shared among threads.

4. **Matrix-Vector Calculation**:
    - The function iterates over the rows of the matrix `A` and computes the dot product with vector `x` for each row, storing the result into vector `y`.

### Note:
- Ensure the matrix `A` is stored in row-major order as is common in C, compared to column-major order which is common in Fortran.
- This implementation assumes that `A` is a 2D array passed as a pointer to arrays (array of pointers) in C.

### Example Usage:
Here's an example of how you might call `gemv_parallel`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    float** A = (float**)malloc(n * sizeof(float*));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i] = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    }
    
    float x[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    float y[3];

    // Initialize matrix A (example values)
    A[0][0] = 1;
    A[0][1] = 2;
    A[0][2] = 3;
    A[1][0] = 4;
    A[1][1] = 5;
    A[1][2] = 6;
    A[2][0] = 7;
    A[2][1] = 8;
    A[2][2] = 9;

    // Call the gemv function
    gemv_parallel(n, A, x, y);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    // Free the allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);

    return 0;
}

This example initializes a 3x3 matrix and a vector, performs the GEMV operation, and prints the result. Don't forget to compile with the OpenMP flag (`-fopenmp` with GCC).
