Output 1:
To convert this Fortran subroutine with OpenACC directives to a C function using OpenMP parallelization, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the function and its arguments in C.
2. Initialize variables and allocate memory as per the Fortran subroutine.
3. Use OpenMP pragmas to parallelize the outer loop.
4. Perform the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation.

Here's the corresponding implementation in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Sample data for testing
    int n = 5;
    int nnz = 9;
    float val[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90};
    int row[] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}; // Extra element for the end of the row
    int col[] = {0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4};
    float x[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    float y[5] = {0};

    // Perform the SpMV operation
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Output the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Details of the C Implementation:

- **Function Declaration**: The `spmv_parallel` function takes six input arguments (`n`, `nnz`, `val`, `row`, `col`, `x`) and one output argument (`y`). This corresponds directly to the Fortran subroutine's arguments.
- **OpenMP Parallel Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, which iterates over the rows of the sparse matrix. Each thread computes the corresponding element in the result vector `y`.
- **Inner Loop**: The inner loop iterates from `row[i]` to `row[i+1] - 1`, summing the products of the nonzero matrix elements and the corresponding elements of the input vector `x`.

### Explanation of Data Structures:

- `val`: An array holding the non-zero values of the sparse matrix.
- `row`: An array of size `n+1` where the `i`-th element represents the index in `val` and `col` where the `i`-th row starts. The extra element at the end indicates the end of the last row.
- `col`: An array holding the column indices corresponding to the values in the `val` array.
- `x`: The input vector.
- `y`: The output vector where the result of the SpMV operation is stored.

By using OpenMP, the outer loop is parallelized to distribute the computation across multiple threads, providing a performance boost for large matrices and vectors.

Output 2:
Certainly! Below is a C implementation of the `spmv_parallel` subroutine using OpenMP for parallelism. This implementation performs a Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation where `val`, `row`, and `col` represent the compressed sparse row (CSR) layout of the sparse matrix.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    // Parallelize outer loop using OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f; // Initialize y[i] to 0.0
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `spmv_parallel` takes the same parameters as the Fortran subroutine:
   - `n`: The number of rows of the matrix.
   - `nnz`: The number of non-zero elements in the matrix.
   - `val`: The array of non-zero values of the matrix (length `nnz`).
   - `row`: The array holding the index of the start of each row in `val` (length `n+1`).
   - `col`: The column indices for each non-zero element in `val` (length `nnz`).
   - `x`: The input vector (length `n`).
   - `y`: The output vector (length `n`).

2. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive tells the compiler to parallelize the following loop. The `private(i, j)` clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of the loop indices `i` and `j`. The `shared` clause indicates the shared data among the threads.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - `for (i = 0; i < n; i++)`: This is the outer loop iterating over each row of the matrix.
   - `y[i] = 0.0f;`: Initialize the output vector entry `y[i]` to zero.
   - `for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++)`: This inner loop iterates over the non-zero elements of the current row.
   - `y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];`: Perform the multiplication and accumulation for the current row entry.

This C implementation closely mirrors the provided Fortran+OpenACC subroutine and should provide similar parallel performance on shared-memory systems using OpenMP.

Output 3:
Certainly! Here's the equivalent C code with OpenMP for the Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication (SpMV) operation defined in the Fortran subroutine with OpenACC:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV)
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage of the spmv_parallel function

    // Example matrix in CSR format
    int n = 3;                   // Number of rows/columns in the matrix
    int nnz = 4;                 // Number of non-zero elements in the matrix
    float val[] = {10, 20, 30, 40}; // Non-zero values
    int row[] = {0, 1, 3, 4};    // Row pointer array
    int col[] = {0, 1, 2, 0};    // Column index array
    float x[] = {1, 2, 3};       // Input vector
    float y[3];                  // Output vector

    // Perform SpMV
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Print the result
    printf("Result: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Data Structures**:
    - `val[]` holds the non-zero values of the matrix.
    - `row[]` holds the cumulative count of non-zero elements up to each row.
    - `col[]` holds the column indices for each non-zero element in `val[]`.
    - `x[]` is the input vector to be multiplied.
    - `y[]` is the output vector.

2. **OpenMP Directive**:
    - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive parallelizes the outer loop, distributing iterations of the loop across multiple threads.
    - `default(none)`: Specifies that no default data-sharing attribute is assumed for variables.
    - `shared(...)`: Specifies variables shared among all threads.
    - `private(...)`: Specifies variables private to each thread.

3. **Computation**:
    - Each thread computes a portion of the output vector `y[]`.
    - For each row `i`, it initializes `y[i]` to 0.0 and then sums up the products of corresponding non-zero matrix values and input vector values.

Compile the above code using a compiler that supports OpenMP (such as GCC) with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv.c
```

Then, run the executable:

```bash
./spmv
```

This code will print the resulting vector `y` after performing the SpMV operation.

Output 4:
To implement the given Fortran and OpenACC subroutine in C and OpenMP, we need to translate the logic and also use OpenMP directives to parallelize the sparse matrix-vector multiplication. The following C function should perform the same operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function to perform sparse matrix-vector multiplication with OpenMP
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Initialize the output vector y to zero
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
    }

    // Perform the SpMV operation
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            #pragma omp atomic
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization of `y`:**
   - The output vector `y` needs to be initialized to zero. This is done in parallel using `#pragma omp parallel for`.

2. **SpMV Operation:**
   - The main computation is also parallelized using `#pragma omp parallel for`. 
   - For each row `i`, we sum the products of `val[j]` and `x[col[j]]` for `j` in the range of `row[i]` to `row[i+1]-1`.
   - The `#pragma omp atomic` directive ensures that updates to `y[i]` are atomic, meaning that they are done without interruption, which is crucial when multiple threads might be updating `y[i]` simultaneously.

### Assumptions:

- The input arrays `val`, `row`, `col`, and `x`, as well as the output array `y`, are of appropriate sizes and have been properly allocated before calling the function.
- The OpenMP library is linked during the compilation.

### Compilation:

To compile the C code with OpenMP, you generally use a compiler flag, for instance with `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
```

This will enable OpenMP support in the GCC compiler. Adjust the compiler invocation according to your development environment if different.

Make sure to test the function thoroughly to ensure correctness, especially since parallel execution can sometimes introduce subtle issues that need to be caught through robust testing.

Output 5:
Here's a C implementation of the given Fortran subroutine for Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) using OpenMP for parallelization:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float* val, const int* row, const int* col, const float* x, float* y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] = 0.0f;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; ++j) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

This function, `spmv_parallel()`, takes the following parameters:

- `n`: Number of rows in the sparse matrix.
- `nnz`: Number of non-zero elements in the sparse matrix.
- `val`: Array containing the non-zero values of the sparse matrix.
- `row`: Array representing the starting index of each row in the `val` array (in CSR format).
- `col`: Array containing the column indices corresponding to each value in `val`.
- `x`: Input vector to multiply by the sparse matrix.
- `y`: Output vector to store the result of the multiplication.

The outer loop is parallelized using `#pragma omp parallel for`, which distributes the iterations of the loop among the available threads. Each thread computes a portion of the result vector `y`.

Make sure you compile your program with an OpenMP-compatible compiler and enable OpenMP support using appropriate compiler flags (e.g., `-fopenmp` for GCC or Clang). Here’s an example of how to compile the code with GCC:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv.c
```

Output 6:
Sure! Below is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP that performs the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation based on the provided Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function for Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) using OpenMP
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    // Initialize output vector y to zero
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
    }

    // Perform the SpMV operation
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) {
            #pragma omp atomic
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Parallel Initialization**: The outer `#pragma omp parallel for` loop initializes the output vector `y` to zero in parallel.
- **Parallel SpMV Operation**: The second `#pragma omp parallel for` loop performs the actual Sparse matrix-vector multiplication:
  - The `private(i, j)` clause ensures each thread has its own copy of the loop indices `i` and `j`.
  - The `#pragma omp atomic` directive ensures that the addition `y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]]` is performed atomically to prevent race conditions.

This implementation should provide similar parallel performance as the Fortran example using OpenACC. Ensure you compile your C code with OpenMP enabled (e.g., by using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC or a similar flag with your compiler).

Output 7:
Certainly! Below is a C function that performs the Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operation using OpenMP for parallelization, which corresponds to the provided Fortran subroutine using OpenACC. 

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the function:

- `n`: Number of rows of the sparse matrix.
- `nnz`: Number of non-zero elements in the sparse matrix.
- `val`: Array containing the non-zero values of the sparse matrix.
- `row`: Array containing the row pointers. `row[i]` marks the start of row `i` in `val` and `col` arrays, and the number of elements of row `i` is given by `row[i+1] - row[i]`.
- `col`: Array containing the column indices corresponding to each non-zero value in `val`.
- `x`: Input vector to be multiplied by the sparse matrix.
- `y`: Output vector to store the result of the multiplication.

### Parallelization with OpenMP

- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. Each thread will compute the result for one or more rows of the output vector `y`.
- Since `y[i]` is calculated independently in each iteration of the outer loop, there is no need for synchronization mechanisms, making this approach efficient.
- The computation inside the loop iterates over the non-zero elements in the current row, accumulating the result in `y[i]`.

### Example Usage

To use the function, you might do something like the following:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    // Define the sparse matrix in CSR format
    int n = 4;  // Number of rows
    int nnz = 9;  // Number of non-zero elements
    float val[9] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90};
    int row[5] = {0, 2, 4, 7, 9};
    int col[9] = {0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3};
    
    // Define the input vector
    float x[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    
    // Allocate the output vector
    float y[4];
    
    // Perform the sparse matrix-vector multiplication
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
    
    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation
To compile the program, use a compiler that supports OpenMP, such as `gcc`, with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv spmv_parallel.c
```

Then, run the executable:

```sh
./spmv
```

This setup will correctly compute the sparse matrix-vector multiplication in parallel using OpenMP, similar to how it would be executed with OpenACC in Fortran.

Output 8:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent function for computing a sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation implemented in C using OpenMP for parallelism, which corresponds to the given Fortran subroutine utilizing OpenACC.

For your reference, SpMV is typically represented in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. This type of representation uses three arrays: `val` (non-zero values), `row` (index pointers to the start of each row), and `col` (column indices of the corresponding elements).

Here's the C function:

```c
#include <omp.h>

/**
 * @brief Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV)
 * 
 * @param n    Number of rows in the matrix
 * @param nnz  Number of non-zero elements
 * @param val  Array of non-zero values
 * @param row  Array of row pointers
 * @param col  Array of column indices
 * @param x    Input vector
 * @param y    Output vector
 */
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0f; // Initialize output vector element
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i + 1]; j++) { // Loop through non-zero elements in the row
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]]; // Perform multiplication and accumulation
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Parallel Loop (`#pragma omp parallel for`)**:
    The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive creates a parallel region and distributes the iterations of the for-loop among the available threads. This ensures that the outer loop running over the rows is executed in parallel.

2. **Private Variables (`private(i, j)`)**:
    The `private(i, j)` clause ensures that each thread gets its own copy of the loop variables `i` and `j`.

3. **Initialization and Computation**:
    - Each thread initializes the corresponding element in the output vector `y[i]` to `0.0f`.
    - The inner loop iterates over the non-zero elements of the current row, using the `val` and `col` arrays to perform the sparse matrix-vector multiplication and accumulation into `y[i]`.

### Important Notes

- **Memory Allocation and Initialization**:
    - Ensure that all arrays (`val`, `row`, `col`, `x`, and `y`) are properly allocated and initialized before calling this function.
    - The `y` array must be allocated with a size of at least `n` elements to store the result.

- **OpenMP Parallelization**:
    - Ensure that you compile the code with OpenMP support. This typically requires the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC or another appropriate flag for your compiler.

Here is an example command to compile with GCC:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
```

This C implementation leverages OpenMP for parallelism similar to how the original Fortran subroutine uses OpenACC, providing efficient multi-threaded execution for the SpMV operation.

Output 9:
Certainly! Here's the equivalent function in C using OpenMP to perform the Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) operation. The C function also uses the compressed row storage (CRS) format for the sparse matrix.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int n = 5; // Size of vector x and y
    int nnz = 13; // Number of non-zero elements in the sparse matrix

    // Example matrix in CRS format
    float val[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130};
    int row[] = {0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 13};
    int col[] = {0, 1, 4, 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4};

    // Example vector x
    float x[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    // Output vector y initialized to 0
    float y[5] = {0};

    // Perform SpMV
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);
    
    // Print out the result in y
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
1. **`spmv_parallel` function**: This function takes the size of the vector `n`, the number of non-zero elements `nnz`, the arrays `val` (values of non-zero elements), `row` (row indices), `col` (column indices), the input vector `x`, and the output vector `y`.
2. **OpenMP parallelization**: The `#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j)` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop over `i`. This ensures that each thread works on a different row of the output vector `y`.
3. **Inner loop**: The inner loop iterates over the non-zero elements in the row `i`, updating the corresponding entry in vector `y`.
4. **Main**: Included for demonstration, this initializes a simple example matrix in CRS format, calls the `spmv_parallel` function, and prints the result.

Compile with OpenMP support by using `-fopenmp` flag (for GCC):
```sh
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
```

Make sure to adjust matrix dimensions and contents according to your specific needs.

Output 10:
The Fortran subroutine `spmv_parallel` you've provided leverages OpenACC directives to perform sparse matrix-vector multiplication in parallel. Below is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP for parallelization. The approach is very similar, with the OpenMP parallel for directive being used to handle the parallelism.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
    // Parallel Region
    #pragma omp parallel for shared(val, row, col, x, y) 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int n = 5;  // number of rows
    int nnz = 7; // number of non-zero elements

    // Example CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format for sparse matrix A
    float val[7] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}; // non-zero values
    int row[6] = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}; // row pointers
    int col[7] = {0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4}; // column indices

    // Example vector x
    float x[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Output vector y
    float y[5] = {0};

    // Call the spmv_parallel function
    spmv_parallel(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y);

    // Print the results
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("y[%d] = %f\n", i, y[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parallel Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the for loop across multiple threads. This directive tells the OpenMP runtime to distribute the iterations of the for loop among the available threads.
2. **Shared Clause**: The `shared` clause indicates which variables are shared among the threads.
3. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop runs over each row of the matrix, and the inner loop runs over the non-zero entries of that row, performing the multiplication and accumulation into the resulting vector `y`.

### Important Considerations:
- Ensure that the OpenMP library is available and linked during compilation. Use the `-fopenmp` flag with `gcc` for compiling the code.
- Pay attention to zero-based indexing in C, as opposed to the one-based indexing typically used in Fortran, to avoid off-by-one errors.

Here is a sample compilation command:
```
gcc -fopenmp -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
./spmv_parallel
```
