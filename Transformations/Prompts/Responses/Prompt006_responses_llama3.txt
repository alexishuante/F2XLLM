Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the matrices. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
To compile this code, you would need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, and link with the OpenMP library. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on a system with multiple CPUs or cores.

  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run on your system.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {

            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to compute the correct indexing. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, like this:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and adjusted the indexing accordingly. Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loops, and private clause to ensure each thread has its own copy of the temporary variables. The collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {

            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to perform the indexing calculations manually. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMM operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to manually calculate the indices using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a compiler like GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run to perform the GEMM operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively. The collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two inner loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
Also, I've used double as the data type for the arrays, assuming that's what you intended with real(kind=8) in the Fortran code. If you need to use a different data type, you can modify the code accordingly.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays a and b. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
To compile this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC or Clang, with the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
You can then call the function from your main program like this:
int main() {
    int m = 100, n = 200, k = 300;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 2.0;
    double *a = malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
    double *b = malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
    double *c = malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

    // Initialize arrays a and b...

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

    // Use the result in c...

    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(c);
    return 0;
}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
Also, I assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the type of the variables and function parameters accordingly.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)

      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the matrices. The collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, similar to the COLLAPSE(2) clause in the OpenACC directive.
Also, the private clause is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread, similar to the PRIVATE clause in the OpenACC directive.
You can compile this function with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on a system with multiple cores.
