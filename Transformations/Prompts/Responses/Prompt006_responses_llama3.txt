--------------- Output 1 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to explicitly calculate the indices for the 2D arrays a and b since C uses row-major ordering, whereas Fortran uses column-major ordering. Also, the loop indices start from 0 in C, whereas they start from 1 in Fortran.

--------------- Output 2 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, we need to specify the loop indices and array indices explicitly, whereas in Fortran, the compiler can infer them from the array declarations. Also, the array pointers in C need to be dereferenced using the * operator. Additionally, the collapse(2) clause in OpenMP tells the compiler to parallelize the two nested loops.

--------------- Output 3 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and that the array indexing is row-major (as is typical in C). Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.

--------------- Output 4 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM operation in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the input matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used the collapse(2) clause to parallelize the two outer loops, just like the COLLAPSE(2) directive in the OpenACC code. This allows OpenMP to parallelize the iteration space of the two loops simultaneously, which can lead to better performance.

--------------- Output 5 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real(kind=8) is equivalent to double in C. Also, I've used the collapse(2) clause to parallelize the two nested loops, just like the COLLAPSE(2) directive in OpenACC. Additionally, I've used the private clause to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
Please note that the memory layout of the matrices a, b, and c is assumed to be column-major, as in Fortran. If your matrices are row-major (as in C), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.

--------------- Output 6 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM operation in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've made the following changes:
Changed the function name to gemm_parallel to match the Fortran subroutine name.
Changed the array indexing to match C's row-major ordering (e.g., a[i * lda + l] instead of a(i, l)).
Removed the implicit none and intent statements, which are not necessary in C.
Changed the real(kind=8) declarations to double, which is the equivalent type in C.
Added the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the loops using OpenMP.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

--------------- Output 7 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C, and that the array indices are 0-based in C (as opposed to 1-based in Fortran). I've also replaced the intent attributes with explicit parameter passing, as C does not have a built-in equivalent.

--------------- Output 8 ---------------
Here is a possible implementation of the GEMM operation in C with OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the input matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for instead of #pragma omp parallel and #pragma omp for to specify that the parallel region should be executed by a team of threads, and that the iterations of the loop should be distributed among the threads. The collapse(2) clause is used to specify that the two nested loops should be collapsed into a single parallel loop.

--------------- Output 9 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C. Also, I've used the collapse(2) clause to parallelize the two outer loops, just like the COLLAPSE(2) directive in OpenACC. Additionally, I've used the private clause to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.

--------------- Output 10 ---------------
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, l, temp)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the input matrices a, b, and c are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order (as is the default in Fortran), you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
