Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively.
Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing in the appropriate arguments.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c respectively. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelism.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
You can then call the gemm_parallel function from your main program, passing in the appropriate parameters.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the matrices. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
Also, the Fortran code uses kind=8 to specify the precision of the real numbers, which is equivalent to double in C.
You can call this function from your main program like this:
int main() {
  int m = 100, n = 100, k = 100;
  double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
  double *a = malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
  double *b = malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
  double *c = malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

  // Initialize matrices a, b, and c

  gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

  // Deallocate matrices a, b, and c

  return 0;
}
This code will perform a parallel Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation using OpenMP.

      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can be parallelized by OpenMP.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on a system with OpenMP support.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run using:
./gemm_parallel
You can also use a library like BLAS or MKL to perform the GEMM operation, which may be more efficient and optimized for your specific hardware.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the collapse(2) clause is used to collapse the two nested loops into a single parallel loop.
To compile this code, you can use the following command:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run using the following command:
./gemm_parallel
You can also use the omp_get_max_threads() function to get the maximum number of threads available on your system, and the omp_get_thread_num() function to get the current thread number. For example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  int num_threads = omp_get_max_threads();
  int thread_num = omp_get_thread_num();
  printf("Thread %d out of %d threads\n", thread_num, num_threads);
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
This will print the thread number and the total number of threads available on your system.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) collapse(2)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the matrices. The collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two inner loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
Also, the private clause is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread, meaning that each thread will have its own copy of these variables.
You can call this function by passing the appropriate parameters, like this:
int m = 100, n = 100, k = 100;
double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
double *a = malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
double *b = malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
double *c = malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

// Initialize matrices a, b, and c

gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

// Use the result matrix c
Note that this is just one possible way to implement the GEMM operation in C with OpenMP. There are many other ways to do it, and the best approach may depend on the specific requirements of your application.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:

      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the collapse(2) clause in the OpenMP directive tells the compiler to collapse the two nested loops into a single loop, which can improve parallelization efficiency.
Also, I assume that the matrices a, b, and c are stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. If your matrices are stored in column-major order, you'll need to adjust the indexing accordingly.
