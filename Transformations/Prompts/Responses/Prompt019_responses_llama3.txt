Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val[:nnz], row[:n+1], col[:nnz], x[:n]) copy(y[:n])
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that the necessary arrays are copied to the device, and the copy clause for the y array ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
To compile this code, you'll need an OpenACC-enabled compiler like pgcc (from the PGI suite) or gcc (with the OpenACC plugin). You can then run the code on a GPU or other accelerator device supported by the compiler.


Output 2:
Here is a possible C/C++ version of the code using OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  #pragma acc kernels present(val, row, col, x, y)
  #pragma acc loop independent
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed that the real type in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C/C++. If you need to use double precision, you can replace float with double and adjust the constants accordingly.
Also, I've used the present clause to specify that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are already allocated and available on the accelerator device. You may need to modify this depending on your specific use case.
Additionally, I've used the kernels directive to specify that this is a kernel that should be executed on the accelerator, and the loop directives to specify the parallelization strategy. The independent clause specifies that the iterations of the outer loop can be executed independently, and the reduction clause specifies that the inner loop performs a reduction operation on the y array.
You may need to adjust the OpenACC directives and clauses to suit your specific use case and compiler.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are copied to the device memory, while the copy clause for y ensures that the result is copied back to the host memory.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause is used to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and the copy clause is used to copy the output array y to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the y array.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model, similar to OpenMP, but it's specifically designed for accelerators like GPUs. The code will be compiled with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as PGI or GCC, and will run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used copyin to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and copy to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the partial sums of y[i].
You can compile this code with a C/C++ compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the Fortran OpenMP code translated to C/C++ with OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(n, nnz, val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the copyin clause in the OpenACC directive ensures that the necessary data is copied to the device, and the copy clause for the y array ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
Keep in mind that OpenACC is designed for GPU acceleration, so you'll need a compiler that supports OpenACC (such as PGI or GCC) and a GPU device to run this code.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector default(none) present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0f;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the gang vector clause is used to parallelize the loop across multiple gangs and vectors, which is similar to the PARALLEL DO directive in OpenMP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. You may also need to link against an accelerator library, depending on your system configuration.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the copyin clause to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and the copy clause to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the partial sums of y[i].


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenACC code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, I've used #pragma acc parallel loop to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) to perform the reduction on the inner loop.
Here's a brief explanation of the OpenACC directives used:
#pragma acc parallel loop: Parallelizes the outer loop across the accelerator (GPU).
copyin(val, row, col, x): Copies the arrays val, row, col, and x from host to device memory.
copy(y): Copies the array y from host to device memory, and also specifies that the result should be copied back to host memory after the kernel execution.
#pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]): Performs a reduction on the inner loop, accumulating the results in y[i].
Note that OpenACC is a directive-based programming model, and the compiler will generate the necessary code to execute the kernel on the accelerator (GPU).


Output 10:
Here is a version of the code in C/C++ using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the present clause to ensure that the arrays are present on the accelerator device.
To compile, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This code should perform the same sparse matrix-vector multiplication as the original Fortran OpenMP code, but using OpenACC for parallelization on an accelerator device.
