Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop present(n, nnz, val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that in OpenACC, the present clause in the parallel directive ensures that the arrays are present on the device. The reduction clause in the loop directive performs a reduction on the y array, which is equivalent to the parallel reduction performed by OpenMP.
Also, the routine seq pragma is used to tell the compiler to generate a sequential version of the routine, which can be called from a device routine. This is not strictly necessary in this case, but it's a good practice to include it to ensure that the routine can be called from a device routine if needed.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y)
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed.
Also, the copyin clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are copied to the device memory, and the copy clause for y ensures that the result is copied back to the host memory.
The reduction(+:y) clause in the inner loop ensures that the partial sums of y are properly reduced across threads.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, I've used #pragma acc kernels loop independent to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) to parallelize the inner loop with a reduction operation on y[i].
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the val and x arrays, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the copyin clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are copied to the accelerator device, while the copy clause for y ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC with the accel plugin or PGI Compiler.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:

    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used copyin to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and copy to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the partial sums of y[i].
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or gcc with the -fopenacc flag.

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(const int n, const int nnz, const float *val, const int *row, const int *col, const float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the gang vector parallelism model, which is similar to the parallel do directive in OpenMP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on a GPU or CPU.

Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;

    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed. Also, the #pragma acc routine seq directive is used to indicate that the routine should be compiled in sequential mode, which is equivalent to the Fortran intent(in) and intent(out) attributes.
The #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i]) directive is used to perform a reduction on the y array.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as PGI or GCC, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <openacc.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If your application uses a different precision, you can modify the types accordingly.
Also, I've used the copyin clause to copy the input arrays val, row, col, and x to the device, and the copy clause to copy the output array y back to the host. The reduction clause is used to perform the reduction operation on the partial sums of y[i] computed by each thread.
You can compile this code with an OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop copyin(val, row, col, x) copy(y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:y[i])
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed real in the Fortran code corresponds to float in C, and integer corresponds to int. Also, the copyin clause in the #pragma acc parallel loop directive ensures that the arrays val, row, col, and x are copied to the device, while the copy clause for y ensures that the result is copied back to the host.
To compile this code, you would need to use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as PGI or GCC. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -Minfo=accel spmv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable that can run on an NVIDIA GPU.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, float *val, int *row, int *col, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop seq
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used the gang vector parallelism, which is similar to the parallel do in OpenMP. The seq keyword in the inner loop ensures that it is executed sequentially, as there are dependencies between iterations.
To compile, use:
gcc -fopenacc -o spmv_parallel spmv_parallel.c
You can then call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module. Let me know if you need help with that!
