Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double if needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations.

Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop using OpenMP. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads.
You can call this function from your code like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    // Use the resulting y array...

    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily modify the type to double or any other precision you need.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations.
You can call this function from your main program like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:

void saxpy(int n, float a, float* x, float* y) {

Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop using OpenMP. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads.
You can call this function by passing the array sizes, scalar value, and array pointers as arguments, like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float x[n];
    float y[n];

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    return 0;
}
This code will perform the AXPY operation on the x and y arrays using OpenMP parallelization.
