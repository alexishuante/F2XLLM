Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop using OpenMP. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads.

Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];

Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop using OpenMP. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads, similar to how OpenACC's kernels directive works.

Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Explanation:
The #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the following for loop across multiple threads.
The loop iterates n times, and each iteration performs the AXPY operation on a single element of the arrays x and y.
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, I changed the loop index to start from 0, as C arrays are 0-indexed. Let me know if you have any questions!


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads.
If you want to use OpenMP tasks instead of parallel loops, you can modify the function like this:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp taskloop
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
This will create a task for each iteration of the loop, which can be executed by any available thread.

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can replace it with double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive is used to parallelize the loop using OpenMP.
To compile this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC or Clang, with the -fopenmp flag.
For example:
gcc -fopenmp -o saxpy saxpy.c
Or:
clang -fopenmp -o saxpy saxpy.c

Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily change it to double if needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations.

Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads.
If you want to use OpenMP 4.5 or later, you can use the declare target directive to enable offloading to accelerators like GPUs, similar to OpenACC:
#pragma omp declare target(saxpy)

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for map(tofrom:y[0:n]) map(x[0:n])
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}

#pragma omp end declare target
This code uses the declare target directive to enable offloading to an accelerator, and the target directive to specify the mapping of data to the device. The teams and distribute clauses are used to distribute the work across multiple teams and threads on the device.
