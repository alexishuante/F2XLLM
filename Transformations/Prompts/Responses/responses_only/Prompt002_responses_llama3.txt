Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    free(x);
    free(y);
    return 0;
}
This code will compute the AXPY operation in parallel using OpenMP.

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed.
Also, I used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop using OpenMP. This will distribute the iterations of the loop across multiple threads.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
Make sure to compile with OpenMP support, for example:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy.c -o saxpy


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the loop using OpenMP.
To compile and run this code, you'll need to use an OpenMP-enabled compiler like GCC or Clang. For example:
gcc -fopenmp saxpy.c -o saxpy
./saxpy
You can also use OpenMP libraries like libomp or libgomp to link against.

    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    float *y = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize x and y arrays...

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    free(x);

Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(int n, float a, float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float precision for the arrays x and y, but you can easily change it to double if needed.
Also, the #pragma omp parallel for directive tells OpenMP to parallelize the loop across multiple threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations.
You can call this function like this:
int main() {
    int n = 1000;
    float a = 2.0;
    float *x = malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    saxpy(n, a, x, y);

    free(x);
    free(y);

    return 0;
}
This code will compute the AXPY operation in parallel using OpenMP.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void saxpy(const int n, const float a, const float *x, float *y) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, I've used const where appropriate to indicate that the function does not modify the input arrays x and y or the scalar a.
The OpenMP directive #pragma omp parallel for tells the compiler to parallelize the loop across multiple threads. Each thread will execute a portion of the loop iterations, and the results will be combined to produce the final output.
You can call this function from your Fortran code using the ISO_C_BINDING module, like this:
use iso_c_binding

interface
    subroutine saxpy(n, a, x, y) bind(c)
        use iso_c_binding
        integer(c_int), value :: n
        real(c_float), value :: a
        real(c_float) :: x(n), y(n)
    end subroutine saxpy
end interface

call saxpy(n, a, x, y)
Assuming your Fortran compiler supports interoperability with C, this should allow you to call the C function from your Fortran code.

Note that I've assumed float as the data type, but you can change it to double or any other type as needed. Also, the loop starts from 0 in C, unlike Fortran which starts from 1.
