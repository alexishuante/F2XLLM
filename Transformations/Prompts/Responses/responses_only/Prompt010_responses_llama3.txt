Output 1:
Here is a possible implementation of the SpMV subroutine in C using OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (int j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, but you can adjust the types as needed. Also, I've used shared to specify that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads, which is the default behavior in OpenMP.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler like GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on multiple threads using OpenMP.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you're using a different precision, you can adjust the types accordingly.
Also, the default(none) clause in the OpenMP directive specifies that no variables are shared by default, and the shared clause explicitly lists the arrays that are shared among threads. This is a good practice to avoid accidental sharing of variables.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double as the data type for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array, based on the Fortran code. If you need to use a different data type, you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used default(shared) to specify that all variables are shared among threads, except for the loop indices i and j, which are declared as private to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler such as GCC, for example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on multiple threads using OpenMP.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as it is the default in C. If you need a different precision, you can change the type of val, x, and y accordingly.
Also, I've used #pragma omp parallel for to parallelize the outer loop, and default(shared) to specify that all variables are shared among threads, except for i and j which are private. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT clauses in the OpenACC directive.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the types accordingly.
Also, I've used the default(none) clause to specify that the compiler should not assume any default sharing or privatization of variables. Instead, I've explicitly listed the shared variables using the shared clause. This is a good practice to avoid potential race conditions or incorrect assumptions about variable sharing.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is commonly used in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision (e.g., float or long double), you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the default(shared) clause to specify that all variables are shared among threads, except for the private variables i and j which are declared as private to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC or Clang, and link it with the appropriate OpenMP library.


Output 7:

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y[i] = 0.0;
        for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
            y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
        }
    }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the floating-point numbers, as is commonly used in scientific computing. If you need to use a different precision (e.g., float or long double), you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the default(none) clause to specify that no variables are shared by default, and then explicitly listed the shared variables using the shared() clause. This is a good practice to avoid accidentally sharing variables that shouldn't be shared.
You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC or Clang. For example:
gcc -fopenmp spmv_parallel.c -o spmv_parallel
This will generate an executable file spmv_parallel that you can run on your system.


Output 8:

  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the types accordingly. Also, I've used default(none) to specify that the variables are not shared by default, and then explicitly listed the shared variables using shared(val, row, col, x, y). This is a good practice to avoid accidental sharing of variables.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i, j)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as well as the y array. If you need to use a different precision, you can modify the code accordingly.
Also, I've used the default(shared) clause to specify that all variables are shared among threads, except for the private variables i and j which are declared using the private clause. This is equivalent to the COPYIN and COPYOUT directives in the OpenACC code.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void spmv_parallel(int n, int nnz, double *val, int *row, int *col, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(val, row, col, x, y)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = 0.0;
    for (j = row[i]; j < row[i+1]; j++) {
      y[i] += val[j] * x[col[j]];
    }
  }
}
Note that I've assumed double precision for the val and x arrays, as is common in many scientific computing applications. If your application uses float precision, you can replace double with float in the code.
Also, the default(none) clause in the OpenMP pragma specifies that the compiler should not assume any default sharing or privatization of variables, and the shared clause specifies that the arrays val, row, col, x, and y are shared among all threads.
