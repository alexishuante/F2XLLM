Output 1:
Certainly! Below is a C implementation of the provided Fortran subroutine `gemm_parallel` using OpenMP to compute a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: 
   - The function `gemm_parallel` has parameters similar to the Fortran subroutine.
   - It accepts pointers for matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` as well as integer values for matrix dimensions and leading dimensions.

2. **omp parallel for**:
   - The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the outer loop (over `j`).
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)` ensures each thread has its own instance of these variables.
   - `schedule(static)` distributes iterations of the loop in a static manner among the threads.

3. **Indexing**:
   - In Fortran, arrays are column-major by default, whereas in C, they are row-major by default.
   - The arrays are accessed using the leading dimensions (`lda`, `ldb`, `ldc`) to properly index elements in C.

Make sure you compile your C program with OpenMP support by adding `-fopenmp` if using GCC:
```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm_parallel.c
```

This implementation should perform similarly to the Fortran version while leveraging parallel computing using OpenMP for efficient execution on multi-core processors.

Output 2:
Certainly! Here is the equivalent C function with OpenMP for the given Fortran subroutine that performs a Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallel region with a parallel for loop
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `gemm_parallel` is defined with parameters corresponding to the Fortran subroutine parameters.
  
2. **Parameters**:
   - `m`, `n`, `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
   - `alpha`, `beta`: Scalars used in the computation.
   - `a`: Matrix A of dimensions `lda` x `k`.
   - `b`: Matrix B of dimensions `ldb` x `n`.
   - `c`: Matrix C of dimensions `ldc` x `n` which is modified in place.
  
3. **Indexing**:
   - Note that Fortran uses 1-based indexing while C uses 0-based indexing. Therefore, loops in C start from `0` to `dimension - 1`, corresponding to Fortran's 1 to `dimension`.
  
4. **OpenMP Parallelization**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for`: This directive tells the compiler to execute the subsequent for loop in parallel.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)`: These variables are private to each thread, meaning each thread will have its own copy.
   - `schedule(static)`: This specifies that iterations of the loop are divided into contiguous chunks, and each chunk is assigned to a thread. Static scheduling is often useful for load balancing when iterations take roughly the same amount of time to complete.
  
5. **Matrix Access**:
   - Multidimensional arrays in C are accessed using pointers and appropriate indexing. The specific elements of the matrices are accessed using the row-major order (since in C arrays are stored in row-major order by default).

By translating the Fortran code into C with OpenMP constructs, you maintain the parallelism and achieve similar performance benefits.

Output 3:
Below is an equivalent C function implementation of the given Fortran subroutine `gemm_parallel`, with OpenMP directives to parallelize the code. This function performs the same Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Parameters and Matrix Indexing:
- `m`: Number of rows of matrices `a` and `c`.
- `n`: Number of columns of matrices `b` and `c`.
- `k`: Number of columns of matrix `a` and number of rows of matrix `b`.
- `alpha`: Scalar multiplier for the product of matrices `a` and `b`.
- `a`: Pointer to matrix `a` (dimensions `lda x k`).
- `lda`: Leading dimension of matrix `a`.
- `b`: Pointer to matrix `b` (dimensions `ldb x n`).
- `ldb`: Leading dimension of matrix `b`.
- `beta`: Scalar multiplier for matrix `c`.
- `c`: Pointer to matrix `c` (dimensions `ldc x n`), which is modified in-place.
- `ldc`: Leading dimension of matrix `c`.

### Notes on Implementation:
1. Matrix indexing in Fortran is 1-based, while C is 0-based. Therefore, the loops in C range from `0` to `m-1`, `n-1`, and `k-1`.
2. The OpenMP `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outermost loop over columns (`j`), and each thread keeps its private copies of `i`, `j`, `l`, and `temp`.
3. Arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` are accessed using row-major indexing to match Câ€™s memory layout.
4. The result is written back into matrix `c` after scaling it with `alpha` and `beta`.

This function can be compiled with an OpenMP-capable C compiler using the `-fopenmp` flag (for GNU compilers). For example:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```

Output 4:
The Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation can be implemented in C with OpenMP as follows:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;

            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }

            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;

    double a[3][3] = {
        {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
        {4.0, 5.0, 6.0},
        {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}
    };

    double b[3][3] = {
        {9.0, 8.0, 7.0},
        {6.0, 5.0, 4.0},
        {3.0, 2.0, 1.0}
    };

    double c[3][3] = {
        {0.0, 0.0, 0.0},
        {0.0, 0.0, 0.0},
        {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}
    };

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, (double *)a, 3, (double *)b, 3, beta, (double *)c, 3);

    // Print the result
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            printf("%f ", c[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `gemm_parallel` is defined to perform the GEMM operation. Its parameters mimic those of the Fortran subroutine.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are pointers to the matrices. `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are leading dimensions of matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization:**
   - `#pragma omp parallel for` directs the compiler to parallelize the subsequent for loop.
   - `private(i, j, l, temp)` ensures that each thread has its own copy of these variables.

3. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - The loop iterates over the dimensions of the output matrix `c`.
   - `temp` is used to accumulate the sum of the product of elements from `a` and `b`.
   - The computed `temp` is then scaled by `alpha` and added to `beta` times the corresponding element in `c`.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:**
   - Creates a simple example with 3x3 matrices for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Calls `gemm_parallel` to perform the matrix multiplication.
   - Prints the resulting matrix `c`.

This code uses `omp.h` for parallelization. Ensure your environment supports OpenMP and compile the program with the `-fopenmp` flag (GCC) or appropriate flag for your compiler. For example:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
```

Output 5:
Certainly! Here's the equivalent implementation of the `gemm_parallel` subroutine written in C with OpenMP:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc)
{
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

Here's an explanation of the important parts of the code:

- **Function Signature**: This declares the function `gemm_parallel` taking the same arguments as in Fortran.
- **Indexing**: In Fortran, array indices start at 1, while in C they start at 0.
- **OpenMP Parallel Directive**: `#pragma omp parallel for` is the OpenMP directive to parallelize the outermost loop. The `private(i, j, l, temp)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of these variables.
- **Index Calculation**: Since C uses row-major order by default, array elements are accessed using `i * lda + l` for matrix `a`, `l * ldb + j` for matrix `b`, and `i * ldc + j` for matrix `c`.

Now you can compile this function with an OpenMP-enabled compiler like `gcc` using the `-fopenmp` flag to enable OpenMP directives.

Output 6:
Here is a corresponding implementation of the given Fortran subroutine in C using OpenMP. The function `gemm_parallel` in C performs the same Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation.

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double* a, int lda, 
                   double* b, int ldb, double beta, double* c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // Parallelize the outer loop with OpenMP
#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **OpenMP Directive**: The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop. This is analogous to the `!$OMP PARALLEL DO` in the Fortran version.
2. **Loop Indices**: In C, array indexing starts from zero, so the loops run from `0` to `m-1`, `n-1`, and `k-1`.
3. **Array Access**: Arrays are accessed using `a[i * lda + l]` and `b[l * ldb + j]` in C, which is equivalent to Fortran's `a(i, l)` and `b(l, j)`.

### Function arguments:
- `m`, `n`, and `k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
- `alpha` and `beta`: Scalars applied in the GEMM operation.
- `a`, `b`, `c`: Pointers to the matrices.
- `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc`: Leading dimensions of the matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

This implementation assumes that the caller manages the OpenMP environment and library linking. Normally, you would compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler using a flag such as `-fopenmp` for GNU compilers. For example:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp gemm.c -o gemm
```

Output 7:
Here is the corresponding C function using OpenMP to perform the generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation illustrated in the Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

// Function for Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    // OpenMP parallelization
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- The function signature: `void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc)` is equivalent to the Fortran subroutine.
    - `m`, `n`, and `k` are matrix dimensions.
    - `alpha` and `beta` are scalar multipliers.
    - `a`, `b`, and `c` are pointers to the first elements of matrices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
    - `lda`, `ldb`, and `ldc` are leading dimensions of matrices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- The code uses OpenMP (`#include <omp.h>`) for parallelization.
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive specifies that the outer `for` loop (over `j` index) is parallelized.
- We use a `static` schedule to distribute iterations statically across threads.
- The loop indices and the temporary accumulation variable `temp` are declared as `private` to ensure each thread works with its own copy.

### Matrix Access
- Matrix elements are accessed using row-major order:
  - `a[i * lda + l]`: Access element \( A[i][l] \)
  - `b[l * ldb + j]`: Access element \( B[l][j] \)
  - `c[i * ldc + j]`: Access element \( C[i][j] \)

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that OpenMP is enabled when compiling the code. For example, using GCC:
  ```sh
  gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
  ```

This implementation is efficient and leverages parallelism to improve performance for large matrix operations.

Output 8:
Certainly! Below is the equivalent C function using OpenMP for the specified Fortran GEMM subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the C code:
1. **Headers**:
   - We include the OpenMP header `<omp.h>` for parallelism support.
   
2. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `gemm_parallel` has parameters similar to the Fortran subroutine, adjusted for C syntax. Pointer notation is used for arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **Variables**:
   - Integer variables `i`, `j`, and `l` are used as loop counters.
   - Double precision variable `temp` is used to accumulate the intermediate result.

4. **OpenMP Parallel Directive**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outermost loop (over `j`).
   - The `private` clause ensures that the loop counters and the temporary variable `temp` are private to each thread.
   - The `schedule(static)` clause distributes iterations of the loop in a static chunk size (default chunk size is determined by OpenMP).

5. **Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the columns of matrix `b` and `c` and this loop is parallelized.
   - The middle loop iterates over the rows of matrix `a` and `c`.
   - The innermost loop iterates over the common dimension `k` of the matrices `a` and `b`.

6. **Matrix Access**:
   - The matrices are accessed using 1D array indexing due to Câ€™s row-major order storage:
     - `a[i * lda + l]` accesses element `(i, l)` of `a`.
     - `b[l * ldb + j]` accesses element `(l, j)` of `b`.
     - `c[i * ldc + j]` accesses element `(i, j)` of `c`.

### Usage:
To use this function in a C program, ensure that you have OpenMP enabled when compiling. For example, with GCC, use the `-fopenmp` flag:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o myprogram myprogram.c
```

This C function mirrors the Fortran subroutine and provides parallelized matrix multiplication with the same computational steps and parallelism structure.

Output 9:
To accomplish the translation from Fortran to C of the given GEMM routine with OpenMP, the following C function can be used:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(j, i, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature:**
   - The function `gemm_parallel` takes integers `m`, `n`, `k`, and `ld*` parameters, which are matrix dimensions and leading dimensions respectively.
   - The `alpha` and `beta` parameters are scaling factors as in GEMM routines.
   - The `double *a`, `double *b`, and `double *c` are pointers to the matrices stored in row-major format (flattened into a single array for C).

2. **OpenMP Directives:**
   - The pragma `#pragma omp parallel for` is used to parallelize the outermost loop over `j` to distribute iterations across threads.
   - The `private(j, i, l, temp)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copies of these variables.
   - The `schedule(static)` clause indicates that loop iterations are divided into contiguous chunks and distributed statically among the threads.

3. **Matrix Access:**
   - The matrices `a`, `b`, and `c` are accessed using row-major indexing, i.e., `a[i][l]` becomes `a[i * lda + l]`, `b[l][j]` becomes `b[l * ldb + j]`, and `c[i][j]` becomes `c[i * ldc + j]`.

### Compilation:
Ensure to compile the code with OpenMP support enabled, typically using `-fopenmp` flag in `gcc`:

```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm gemm.c
```

This code should provide equivalent functionality to the provided Fortran subroutine but translated into C with OpenMP for parallel execution.

Output 10:
Below is a C function that implements the Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) using OpenMP, equivalent to the provided Fortran subroutine:

```c
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;

    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Parameters:**
    - `m, n, k`: Dimensions of the matrices.
    - `alpha, beta`: Scalars used in the linear combination.
    - `a`: Pointer to the first input matrix `a` with dimensions `lda` by `k`.
    - `lda`: Leading dimension of array `a`.
    - `b`: Pointer to the second input matrix `b` with dimensions `ldb` by `n`.
    - `ldb`: Leading dimension of array `b`.
    - `c`: In-out pointer to the matrix `c` with dimensions `ldc` by `n`, which is updated by the function.
    - `ldc`: Leading dimension of array `c`.

2. **OpenMP Parallelization:**
    - The outer loop that iterates over column indices `j` is parallelized using `#pragma omp parallel for`. Each thread will handle a subset of the columns of matrix `c`.
    - Private variables are declared within the `parallel for` directive to ensure each thread gets its own instance of these loop counters and temporary variables.
    - The `schedule(static)` clause ensures that the loop iterations are divided into contiguous chunks of iterations, which are statically assigned to the threads. This is similar to what you had in the Fortran code.

3. **Matrix Indexing:**
    - For accessing elements in matrices `a`, `b`, and `c`, pointer arithmetic is used: `i * lda + l`, `l * ldb + j`, and `i * ldc + j`, respectively. This is because C matrices are typically stored in row-major order, whereas Fortran arrays are column-major, so the indexing has to account for that.

### Usage:

The `gemm_parallel` function can be called in your main program or elsewhere in your C code as follows:

```c
int main() {
    // Example usage
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 3;
    int lda = 3, ldb = 3, ldc = 3;
    double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;
    double a[9] = { /* Fill with appropriate values */ };
    double b[9] = { /* Fill with appropriate values */ };
    double c[9] = { /* Fill with appropriate values */ };

    gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, lda, b, ldb, beta, c, ldc);

    return 0;
}
```

Make sure to compile the program with OpenMP support, typically done by adding `-fopenmp` to the compiler flags if using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -fopenmp -o gemm_parallel gemm_parallel.c
```
