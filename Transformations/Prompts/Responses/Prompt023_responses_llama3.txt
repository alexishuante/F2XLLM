Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <hip/hip_complex.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0f;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: This code assumes a column-major storage format for the matrix A, similar to Fortran. Also, HIP is a C++ API, so the code is written in C++ style.
To compile and run this code, you'll need to use a HIP-enabled compiler (such as hipcc) and link against the HIP runtime library. You may also need to set up your environment to use a GPU device.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ code with HIP (for AMD GPUs) and OpenMP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <omp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(j, sum)
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0f;
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note: This code assumes a column-major storage format for the matrix A, which is the default in Fortran. If your matrix is stored in row-major format, you'll need to transpose the indices in the inner loop.
To compile this code for HIP, you'll need to use a compiler that supports HIP, such as the HIP-clang compiler. You can then run the code on an AMD GPU using the hipLaunchKernel function.
For example:
hipcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.cpp
hipLaunchKernel(gemv_parallel, dim3(n), dim3(256), 0, 0, n, A, x, y)
This will launch the gemv_parallel kernel on the GPU with n threads in the x-dimension, and 256 threads per block.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 3:
Here is a C++ version of the code using HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The kernel is written in CUDA C++ and performs the same calculation as the original Fortran OpenMP code.
Also, note that the matrix A is assumed to be stored in column-major order, as is typical in Fortran. If your matrix is stored in row-major order (as is typical in C/C++), you'll need to adjust the indexing in the kernel accordingly.
You can compile this code with a command like:
hipcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.cpp
And run it with a command like:
./gemv_parallel <n> <A_file> <x_file> <y_file>
Where <n> is the size of the matrix, and <A_file>, <x_file>, and <y_file> are the files containing the matrix A, vector x, and output vector y, respectively.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 4:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hipLaunchKernel(GEMVKernel, dim3(1), dim3(n), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {

    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU. The GEMVKernel kernel is executed in parallel across the blocks and threads of the GPU, with each thread computing a single element of the output vector y.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.
Also, you can use hipcpp to parallelize the code, here is an example:
#include <hipcpp/hipcpp.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  hip::KernelLaunch(GEMVKernel) (n, A, x, y);
}

HIP_KERNEL void GEMVKernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i = hip::blockIdx_x * hip::blockDim_x + hip::threadIdx_x;
  if (i < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
You can use hipcpp to parallelize the code and run it on the GPU.


Output 5:
Here is a version of the code you provided, translated into C++ with HIP:
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int blockSize = 256;
  int numBlocks = (n + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
  hipLaunchKernel(gemv_kernel, dim3(numBlocks), dim3(blockSize), 0, 0, n, A, x, y);
}

__global__ void gemv_kernel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < n) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[idx * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[idx] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows you to run kernels on AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, as well as CPUs. The gemv_parallel function launches a HIP kernel, which is executed on the device (GPU or CPU). The gemv_kernel function is the actual kernel that performs the matrix-vector multiplication.
Also, note that this code assumes that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, and that the vectors x and y are stored in contiguous arrays. If your data is stored in a different format, you may need to modify the kernel accordingly.
You can compile this code using the HIP compiler, hipcc, and run it using the hipconfig utility to specify the device and other runtime options. For example:
hipcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.cpp
hipconfig --device 0 gemv_parallel
This will run the gemv_parallel kernel on the first device (GPU or CPU) available on your system.


Output 6:
Here is a version of the code in C++ with HIP:

      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API to launch a kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword to define the kernel function that runs on the GPU. The kernel function is similar to the original Fortran code, but uses C++ syntax and indexing.
Also, the hipLaunchKernel function is used to launch the kernel on the GPU, and the dim3 variables are used to specify the block and grid dimensions.
You can compile this code with a HIP-capable compiler, such as the HIP-clang compiler, and run it on a GPU that supports HIP.

}
Note that this code uses the HIP runtime API, which allows you to run kernels on AMD GPUs. The hipLaunchKernel function launches the GEMVKernel kernel on the GPU, and the __global__ keyword indicates that the kernel is executed on the GPU. The blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x calculation is used to map the GPU threads to the rows of the matrix.
Also, note that the matrix A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, and the arrays x and y are assumed to be stored in contiguous memory.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a system with an AMD GPU.

You can also use the hipconfig tool to generate the build files for your project.

Also, the matrix A is assumed to be stored in row-major order, and the vectors x and y are assumed to be stored in contiguous arrays.
You can compile this code with a HIP-enabled compiler, such as hipcc, and run it on a system with an AMD GPU.
