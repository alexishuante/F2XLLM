Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and indexing is done using pointer arithmetic. The lda, ldb, and ldc parameters represent the leading dimensions of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively. The schedule(static) clause is used to specify the scheduling of the loop iterations among the threads, similar to the Fortran version.
Also, the private clause is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copy of the variables i, j, l, and temp, to avoid race conditions.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on multiple threads using OpenMP.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, we need to explicitly specify the array indices using the * operator, and we use pragma omp parallel for instead of parallel do to parallelize the loops. Additionally, we use private to specify the variables that should be private to each thread, and schedule(static) to specify the scheduling policy.
Also, note that in C, arrays are 0-indexed, so we start the loops from 0 instead of 1.
You can call this function by passing the matrices a, b, and c as 1D arrays, along with the dimensions m, n, k, and the scalars alpha and beta. The matrices a and b should be stored in column-major order (Fortran-style), and the matrix c should be stored in row-major order (C-style).


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, and the intent attributes are not applicable. The real(kind=8) type is equivalent to double in C.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the appropriate arguments.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {

      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing in the appropriate arguments. For example:
int m = 100, n = 200, k = 300;
double alpha = 1.0, beta = 2.0;
double *a = malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
double *b = malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
double *c = malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

// Initialize a, b, and c arrays...

gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, k, b, n, beta, c, n);

// Use the result in c...
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the subroutine you provided in Fortran:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)

            temp = 0.0;

                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to manually calculate the indices using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the schedule(static) clause is used to specify the scheduling of the iterations among the threads in the team.

You can compile this code with OpenMP support using a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
And then call the function gemm_parallel from your main program.
