Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C, and the intent attributes are not applicable. The real(kind=8) type is equivalent to double in C.
The OpenMP directives are similar in both Fortran and C, with the main difference being the syntax for parallelizing the loops using !$OMP in Fortran and #pragma omp in C.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the arrays. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the arrays a, b, and c, respectively.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing in the appropriate arguments. For example:
int main() {
  int m = 100, n = 100, k = 100;
  double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;
  double *a = malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
  double *b = malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
  double *c = malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

  // Initialize a, b, and c with some values...

  gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, m, b, k, beta, c, m);

  free(a);
  free(b);
  free(c);

  return 0;
}
This code will perform a parallel matrix multiplication using OpenMP, similar to the Fortran subroutine.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters represent the leading dimensions of the matrices, which are used to calculate the correct indexing.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and we use pointer arithmetic to access elements. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters represent the leading dimensions of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively.
To compile this code, you can use a command like:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run.
You can also use the restrict keyword to ensure that the pointers a, b, and c do not alias each other:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *restrict a, int lda, double *restrict b, int ldb, double beta, double *restrict c, int ldc) {
  ...
}
This can help the compiler optimize the code better.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and matrix indexing is done manually using the lda and ldb parameters. Also, the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C.
You can compile and run this code using a C compiler that supports OpenMP, such as GCC. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
./gemm_parallel
This code will perform the same Generalized Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operation as the original Fortran subroutine, using OpenMP for parallelization.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function implemented in C and OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c, respectively. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the appropriate arguments for the matrices a, b, and c, as well as the scalars alpha and beta.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;

  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, so we need to use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of the matrices. Also, the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to specify the leading dimensions of the matrices, which is equivalent to the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters in the Fortran subroutine.
You can call this function in the same way as the Fortran subroutine, passing the matrices a, b, and c as arrays of doubles, and the dimensions m, n, and k as integers.
Also, you need to link with OpenMP library and compile with OpenMP flag, for example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will create an executable file gemm_parallel that you can run.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenMP for the provided Fortran subroutine:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and indexing is done using pointer arithmetic. Also, the schedule(static) clause is used to specify the scheduling of the loop iterations among the threads, which is equivalent to the SCHEDULE(STATIC) directive in the Fortran code.
You can compile this code with an OpenMP-enabled compiler, such as GCC, using the -fopenmp flag. For example:
gcc -fopenmp gemm_parallel.c -o gemm_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemm_parallel that can be run on multiple threads using OpenMP.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C and OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to represent the leading dimensions of the matrices. The private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that each thread should have its own private copies of the i, j, l, and temp variables.
Also, the schedule(static) clause is used to specify that the iterations of the loop should be divided among the threads in a static manner. This can be changed to schedule(dynamic) or schedule(guided) depending on the specific requirements of the application.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C using OpenMP:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c respectively. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
You can call this function by passing the appropriate parameters, for example:
int m = 100, n = 100, k = 100;
double alpha = 1.0, beta = 0.0;
double *a = malloc(m * k * sizeof(double));
double *b = malloc(k * n * sizeof(double));
double *c = malloc(m * n * sizeof(double));

// Initialize matrices a and b

gemm_parallel(m, n, k, alpha, a, k, b, n, beta, c, n);

// Use the result matrix c

free(a);
free(b);
free(c);
This code assumes that the matrices a, b, and c are stored in column-major order, which is the default in Fortran. If your matrices are stored in row-major order, you'll need to adjust the indices in the function accordingly.
