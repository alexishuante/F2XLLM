Output 1:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c respectively. Also, the loop indices i, j, and l are declared inside the function, and the temp variable is declared separately to ensure each thread has its own copy.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, since C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with explicit dimensions like Fortran does.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array accesses are done using pointer arithmetic instead of the Fortran style a(i, l) notation.


Output 4:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the matrices a, b, and c respectively. Also, the loop indices i, j, and l are declared inside the function, and the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to make them private to each thread.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the Fortran OpenMP code you provided:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are typically represented as pointers, and indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code that implements a Generalized Matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, array indices start at 0, so the loop counters start at 0 instead of 1. Also, the array access is done using pointer arithmetic instead of the Fortran style array access.


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are 0-indexed, so the loop indices start from 0 instead of 1. Also, the array indices are calculated manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters, since C/C++ does not have built-in support for 2D arrays with arbitrary leading dimensions like Fortran does.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
#include <omp.h>

void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are represented as pointers, and indexing is done manually using the lda and ldb parameters, which represent the leading dimensions of the arrays a and b, respectively. Also, the real(kind=8) type in Fortran corresponds to double in C/C++.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
    int i, j, l;
    double temp;
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            temp = 0.0;
            for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
                temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
            }
            c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
        }
    }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are represented as pointers, and matrix indexing is done manually using the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters. Also, the implicit none statement is not needed in C/C++, and the intent attributes are not necessary as the parameters are explicitly declared as int or double *.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent C/C++ OpenMP code for the given Fortran OpenMP code:
void gemm_parallel(int m, int n, int k, double alpha, double *a, int lda, double *b, int ldb, double beta, double *c, int ldc) {
  int i, j, l;
  double temp;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, l, temp) schedule(static)
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      temp = 0.0;
      for (l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        temp += a[i * lda + l] * b[l * ldb + j];
      }
      c[i * ldc + j] = alpha * temp + beta * c[i * ldc + j];
    }
  }
}
Note that in C/C++, arrays are passed to functions as pointers, so the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters are used to access the elements of the arrays a, b, and c respectively. Also, the private clause in the OpenMP directive is used to specify that the variables i, j, l, and temp are private to each thread.
