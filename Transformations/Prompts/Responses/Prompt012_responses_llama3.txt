Output 1:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma acc data copy(A(:,:), x(:), y(:))
    #pragma acc parallel loop private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to adjust the indexing in the inner loop to match this. Also, the reduction(+:sum) clause is used to avoid race conditions in the parallel reduction.
Also, you need to compile with OpenACC enabled, for example with PGI compiler:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -Minfo=accel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate the CUDA code and compile it for NVIDIA GPU.


Output 2:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and array indices are incremented differently than in Fortran. Also, OpenACC uses #pragma directives to specify parallel regions and loops, whereas OpenMP uses !$OMP directives.
To compile this code, you would use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as pgcc (Portland Group C Compiler) or gcc with the OpenACC plugin. For example:
pgcc -acc -ta=nvidia -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on an NVIDIA GPU.


Output 3:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are passed as pointers, and the n parameter is used to specify the size of the arrays. Also, the loop independent directive tells OpenACC that each iteration of the outer loop can be executed independently, and the reduction(+:sum) directive specifies that the sum variable is a reduction variable that is updated atomically.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc or nvc, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.

Output 4:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
    int i, j;
    double sum;

    #pragma acc parallel loop private(sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, OpenACC uses #pragma acc parallel loop to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) to perform the reduction on the variable sum.


Output 5:
Here is the equivalent C code using OpenACC:
#pragma acc routine seq
void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;
  #pragma acc parallel loop gang vector
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in the C version, I assumed A is a 1D array stored in row-major order, so I used A[i * n + j] to access the element at row i and column j. Also, I used the gang vector parallelism to distribute the outer loop across the GPU gangs, and the reduction clause to perform the sum reduction in parallel.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler like pgcc or gcc with the -acc flag. For example:
pgcc -acc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate a binary that can run on a GPU accelerator.


Output 6:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;
    #pragma acc data copy(A[:n*n], x[:n], y[:n])
    #pragma acc parallel loop private(j, sum)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j). Also, the reduction clause is used to parallelize the sum reduction.
To compile, use:
gcc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c -lOpenACC
You can also use the openacc compiler wrapper:
openacc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


Output 7:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <accel.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are represented as pointers, and the array indices are calculated manually. Also, the #pragma acc kernels directive tells the compiler to parallelize the outer loop, and the #pragma acc loop reduction directive specifies that the inner loop is a reduction operation.
To compile this code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler such as pgcc (Portland Group C Compiler) with the -acc flag:
pgcc -acc gemv_parallel.c -o gemv_parallel
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that can be run on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 8:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, double *A, double *x, double *y) {
  int i, j;
  double sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the matrix A as A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j) like in Fortran.
Also, OpenACC uses #pragma acc kernels to parallelize the outer loop, and #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) to perform the reduction on the sum variable.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI suite, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 9:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
  int i, j;
  float sum;

  #pragma acc kernels loop independent
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum = 0.0;
    #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    y[i] = sum;
  }
}
Note that in C, arrays are row-major, so we need to access the elements of matrix A using A[i * n + j] instead of A(i, j).
Also, the #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum) directive is used to perform a reduction on the sum variable, which is equivalent to the PRIVATE clause in OpenMP.
You can compile this code with a OpenACC-enabled compiler, such as pgcc from the PGI compiler suite, and run it on a GPU or other accelerator device.


Output 10:
Here is the equivalent function in C with OpenACC:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openacc.h>

void gemv_parallel(int n, float *A, float *x, float *y) {
    int i, j;
    float sum;

    #pragma acc kernels loop independent
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum = 0.0;
        #pragma acc loop reduction(+:sum)
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i * n + j] * x[j];
        }
        y[i] = sum;
    }
}
Note that in the C version, I assumed that the matrix A is stored in row-major order, which is the default in C. Also, I used float as the data type, but you can change it to double if needed.
To compile the C code with OpenACC, you can use a compiler that supports OpenACC, such as GCC or PGI. For example, with GCC, you can use the following command:
gcc -fopenacc -o gemv_parallel gemv_parallel.c
This will generate an executable file gemv_parallel that you can run on a GPU or CPU.
